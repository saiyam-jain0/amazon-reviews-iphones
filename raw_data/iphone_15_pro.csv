Despite trouble shooting all methods at home and then at Verizon to get cellular working and the esim activated, even the employee said they'd never seen a 15 pro show no cellular like this.

What I received was accurate in model and storage, and the device appeared pristine with a flawless screen and only two battery cycles. However, upon closer inspection, both the battery and screen had been replaced with non-genuine parts. While the phone functions, it now displays a warning that genuine Apple components are missing—effectively voiding any Apple warranty or support options. More concerning is that the display runs at only 60Hz instead of the ProMotion 120Hz expected from the Pro model, which is disappointing and likely a result of the screen replacement. Additionally, the iPhone 15 Pro is known for heat issues, and this unit is no exception. Given the third-party battery, I can’t be certain if this is normal or worsened. Overall, the phone works for my basic needs, and the condition is physically great, but the presence of non-Apple parts and degraded features make this a lackluster purchase for anyone expecting a true “like new” experience.","R1AN7U0FKDNVA5",,,,,,,,,,,,"Misleading Condition – Not Apple-Serviced, Non-Genuine Parts","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1AN7U0FKDNVA5","Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2025","1575","50",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Blue Titanium, Size: 128GB","B0CMYXFK3R","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Blue Titanium","Size","128GB"

The iPhone 15 Pro had a few scratches around the frame when I received it but nothing major. Screen looked good and battery health was at 100%. I ordered the phone from Woot for myself. I transferred data from the Android device I was replacing seamlessly. The phone came with a SIM card tool remover (not needed as phone supports eSIM only) and a lightning cable instead of a USB C Cable for charging. I sent a message to Woot to send me the correct cable for the phone and the only response I got from Woot was to confirm my order number. I contacted Amazon as well and they told me to order a USB C cable that will be paid for via account credit. That issue was resolved. After one day of use, the phone froze while charging overnight and needed a forced restart. Then, the phone froze again the following days. The phone also ran hot and the battery drained fast. After a week, I sent the phone back and I am awaiting my refund. I sent back the phone after performing a factory reset clearing all my data with the lightning cable it came with.

Not this time! I got it and it is immediately draining fast the battery from a full charge. Did the diagnostics (software updates, apps running in the background etc). No solution. I was previously under the impression that Apple put new batteries in these phones before reselling them. That is no longer (apparently) the case. I am super disappointed. Do I have time to order replacement, get that set-up, return this one, etc? No, come on that's a multi-day task! I also don't have time to sit around on calls for tech support. The bottom line is that I won't be buying Apple certified refurbished again - I'll probably use a different vendor who actually bothers to give you a new battery. Very disappointed to say the least.

TLDR: I wouldn’t recommend purchasing given quality of phone (scratched/poor battery health for price point) as well as customer service from the seller. I bought the iPhone 15 Pro in excellent condition for $770 from BuySpry, and there were already issues with the phone arriving late when my current phone had died due to the battery in the cold. The phone that arrived had numerous scratches on the display hidden by a screen protector (which seems to be a pattern based on other reviews shown), dirt/debris in the charging port, as well as a battery with 91% health and 320+ battery cycles already used. I was surprised given the number of reviews for excellent phones with 95%+ health and low battery cycles. Further, scratches on the display do NOT qualify as Excellent/Good quality phones according to Amazon Renewed guidelines. The real issue came when trying to resolve with the seller. Each response took 1-2 days with constant follow up on my end, and mind you I did not have a functional phone at this point. They refused to do a partial refund, and eventually also refused to send a replacement phone, stating that “there was no availability left.” I attached a screenshot I took the very next day, which showed that indeed I could receive a phone from the same seller by next day delivery.

I purchased an iPhone 15 Pro Max 512GB, and initially, everything appeared to be in perfect condition. However, I soon started experiencing issues with location services. At first, I thought it was a problem with the Maps app, so I tried using other navigation apps — but the same frustrating issue persisted. Eventually, I realized the problem was with the phone itself, not the apps. I hoped a software update might resolve it, assuming it was a software glitch, but even after updates, the issue remained. It’s clearly a problem with the phone’s location services. I contacted the dealer, but they informed me that the return window had passed and there was nothing they could do. If you're considering buying a phone from here, be cautious — some issues might not be immediately obvious. Now, I’m forced to carry my old phone just to use maps, which is incredibly frustrating as I travel frequently. I’ll likely need to replace this phone entirely, which means spending even more money. To the seller: please ensure that all devices are thoroughly checked before being sold. This experience has been very disappointing.","R1C8SLBSW8H4EH",,,,,,,,,,,"7","I would never recommend this.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1C8SLBSW8H4EH","Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2025","1575","150",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Black Titanium, Size: 512GB","B0CMYXFK3R","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Black Titanium","Size","512GB"

The screen and the rest of the phone appeared to be free from scratches and looked nice. The phone arrived with a completely dead battery. Once I charged it with my Apple charger I was greeted with the hello screen but was unable to get past it. The screen seemed to barely respond to touch input and would only briefly flash a password screen for a fraction of a second. I was also not able to bring up the slider to turn the phone off. I was able to get the phone to restart with volume up, volume down and holding power but I never could get it to shutdown. Also, the back of the phone was unusually warm the entire time it was on. Amazon should at least verify that a phone powers on and off before labeling it “like new”. UPDATE - After returning the first Iphone 15 Pro, I ordered another one from Amazon Resale. This time they sent me a iPhone 12 pro 512mb when I had ordered a iPhone 15 Pro 1TB. I thought that a returned phone would go through some basic checks before being sent to customers but that does not seem to be the case based on my experiences.

Battery: When included, batteries have a capacity that exceeds 80% of the original battery life. Accessories: Generic or original equipment manufacturer accessories and packaging provided.

I haven't have any problems with my 15 Pro yet, other than it seems to use a lot of the battery up, when I was hoping it would be a much bigger improvement over my 6 year old XR's battery usage. Physically, it only has some scratches on the phone sides revealing the metal underneath, and a very light scratch, near imperceptible on the screen. It was deemed a refurbished excellent. I'm disappointed though that it arrived with a 88% battery health and a high number of cycles in the 560's *now 570. That's a high amount of cycles. I'm happy with the phones performance and feel so far. It's faster than my previous phone, and some better connection experiences around town. No problems setting up or transferring.

The only issue I ran into is that the screen’s water beading layer was completely gone so they probably did a specific technique to get scratches off. No biggie. Just an extra few dollars for a screen protector to mimic the feel of a clean screen cause you don’t want a phone that smudges easily. Besides that. It’s great. Camera is perfectly fine. Phone came ready for setup. Looks clean besides that one ding I’m unsure of even being a ding. Doesn’t even identify any replaced parts so it’s most likely a back glass repair phone.

But let me tell you something. The phone looks brand new with no scratches, dents, or scuff marks. I checked the battery cycle and it was only fully charged ~56x. I also checked for the repair history and no parts were replaced according to the iPhone’s history. This phone does not come with the 1 year warranty from Apple, but considering the money I saved I am ok with that. Since this is a refurbished phone I received all 3rd party accessories such as iphone box, usb-c cable, usb-c 20w adapter, screen protector. The only negative I have is the screen protector was made for the 2020 6.1 iphone. As this fits over the screen it does fit the edges of the iPhone 15. This should really come with the proper screen protector. Overall, if you want to save some money I would recommend trying this first before buying as new.","R3HCGOCGIILN1C",,,,,,,,,,,"2","No Scratch, or dings.

I was told a password would be sent to my email on the delivery date that I would need to provide to the delivery driver to receive the order. That never happened and the package was left on my front porch. Otherwise I was very fortunate to get a phone that’s practically band new and still under limited warranty. It showed up in a iPhone box with all original packaging. There is not a speck of dust anywhere, no scratches or any signs of use at all. Seems like someone just opened the box and returned it without using it. I’m very impressed and happy with my purchase. Removed a star simply because it should have been clear that it is a US version without a physical SIM card slot.","R1AOGNWC7VM5PT","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61DJJSiO8iL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71QUwdMG2FL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/812wLXE+MAL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,,,"Brand new","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1AOGNWC7VM5PT","Reviewed in Canada on January 3, 2025","1575","100",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Blue Titanium, Size: 128GB","B0CMYXFK3R","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Blue Titanium","Size","128GB"
