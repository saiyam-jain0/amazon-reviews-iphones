The only reason it receives three stars is that the original screen has been replaced with a low-quality, non-original Apple screen. The replacement screen functions adequately, but its non-flat surface is noticeable, particularly when attempting to install a glass screen protector. Despite trying several kits, none of them were successful. As this is a child’s phone, I prioritize its protection. However, the inferior screen renders this protection ineffective. Consequently, I have been forced to settle for a low-quality plastic screen protector that offers insufficient protection compared to a glass one. It is important to note that the quality of the screen used appears to be subpar. While I cannot definitively attribute this to personal misfortune, I believe the low quality of the screen is a systemic issue.

I have since given them a second chance and purchased a second phone. It came on time and worked as expected. The battery life isn't perfect. But it is FAR better than my previous phone. It doesn't work like new but close enough. I'm giving them 3 stars because I originally gave 1 and the second phone is fine and I'm splitting the difference. My original review was as follows: I knew it was a risk trying a “renewed” phone. But the return stories made it worth the risk. I don’t know what these people did but I’ve lived off Amazon for years and this has been the worst. The phone wouldn’t turn on (we live and breathe off technology. We know how to manage a phone). It took over an hour on the phone (my working phone) with support to be ALLOWED to return it. Then it was FOUR days before UPS picked it up and over a week before it reached the amazon warehouse where amazon neglected to acknowledge its arrival. When I did contact them to ask what was up because it’s a lot of money and both the return message and the support person said I would receive my refund once they received the phone. Amazon told me they were going to HOLD MY MONEY FOR A MONTH! Because “it was a lot of money”. No joke! What in the world?! My current phone is dying. What am I supposed to do?! Worst purchase/return ever! Update: The refund came through sooner than 30 days. I can’t say if it had to do with customer service or in response to my repeated phone calls or my review. Hard to tell. Although, once the refund was issued, they said the funds would not be available for up to 7 days because, again, it’s “a lot of money.” I’ve decided to give them another chance. Will update the review either way, positive or negative experience. To be continued…","R1JOU660IB5769",,,,,,,,"17","Return process is the worst!

The phone itself was in perfect condition with no obvious signs that it was a used phone. It did take a surprisingly long time to reach me- about 12 days from when I ordered it. I had trouble when it came to connecting with my carrier (a prepaid T-Mobile MVNO), however. The SIM would activate, but would show as ""Not connected"" and ""Phone not allowed"" in the settings. I spent a week going back and forth with my carrier's customer service and they basically just threw up their hands and insisted the device must be carrier locked, despite it showing as unlocked in the settings, despite it coming up as unlocked/not-blacklisted in online IMEI checkers, despite it being able to connect to both Verizon and AT&T MVNO trial eSIMs. My suspicion is that the IMEI is on some internal blacklist for either my MVNO or T-Mobile in general, but I couldn't get any customer service rep to actually escalate this to someone who could check. I would have kept this phone and switched to another carrier, but my prepaid plan had just been renewed a little over a month ago and I had ~11 months of service that I wouldn't be able to get refunded if I switched. I had been without cell service for the week I was working with them and being without cell service for an additional 12 days while waiting for a replacement from Amazon Renewed wasn't really a viable option for me. So, I ended up ordering a brand new phone from Apple directly. It cost more than a renewed phone, but not as much as I'd lose by switching carriers. Bottom line- there was probably an issue with the renewed phone's IMEI from whatever it's previous life was. It wouldn't have been an issue with any other network, and by all rights my carrier SHOULD have been able to identify and fix the issue. Thankfully, the return policy allowed me to return this phone.","RZS21WQ5SLI05",,,,,,,,"44","Great physical condition, but issues with IMEI and carrier","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZS21WQ5SLI05","Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2022","6130","203",,,"Size: 256GB, Color: Starlight, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed Premium","B09LKXHWCF","Size","256GB","Color","Starlight","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed Premium"

They offered a return for full refund, but I did not want to return and go back to my old phone while figuring out another purchase (plus 2 more phone transfers). I asked if they could do a partial refund for the inconvenience (and the fact they could check for this issue before sending the phone). They said the best they could do was $20 which seems pretty low for the inconvenience. I asked them to do their best on the refund and then I have not heard from them since for over a week.

If you can find your preferred phone at the Apple store, or in Apple Refurbished store, Apple puts a brand new battery with a 100% health, new outer shell, and sells with the original cable and USB adapter, and at about the same price as the Amazon renewed store. And you can buy AppleCare+! I am referring to a device I purchased directly from Amazon.com and not from any third-party seller. Amazon Renewed sells devices with battery not at 100%, as they state in the description. The USB adapter is not apple, and not so sure about the lightning cable. The outer shell/glass/screen is not new - they were just what they were when Amazon Renewed acquired those. In summary, you are better off purchasing from the Apple Refurb store, and if not get a new model phone. iPhone 13 mini being discontinued (Apple is supremely stupid and highly inconsiderate to discontinue a device that has a loyal following and the only one of its kind), used ones are the only way to go. So, if purchased from Amazon Renewed expect to pay another $99 to replace the battery at the Apple store sooner than expected. In summary, at this price it is NOT a good deal for a used phone.","RZPURC1RA2FAE",,,,,,,,"4","Not a great deal, battery at 85% when received","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZPURC1RA2FAE","Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2023","6130","203",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Blue, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B09LKXHWCF","Size","128GB","Color","Blue","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

A little googling shows this to be a ""thing."" So far no luck with the trouble shooting, but this will definitely be an issue if I can't figure it out. I still wish smaller phones were easier to find. Even this one is bigger than I'd like, but when your old one is unsupported, you have no choice but to upgrade. Was glad to find a mini, assuming the camera situation gets worked out. Edit: turns out this phone had a hardware defect (with the compass), so I had to return it. My refund was honored without delay. It's a shame, because otherwise, this phone functioned beautifully. The phone I purchased as a replacment (not from the same vendor) does not work as well.","R1GVWSXKRCYFDJ",,,,,,,,,"Mostly good; issue may be with Apple, not the seller, but worth noting (EDIT: returned)","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1GVWSXKRCYFDJ","Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2024","6130","203",,,"","B09LKXHWCF",,,,,,,,

There’s two concerns: one the screen has few superficial scratches that are visible from about 12 inches. The excellent condition (ie, the standard that applies to all renewed premium cell phones) product narrative states there should be no visible scratches. Second, the screen has a slight visible lift (as in not sitting completely flush with the chassis) on the bottom left side; although not enough to impair operability, but prominent enough to make me question the grading criteria/ QC standard. As for the battery, it checks out at 94%. It would’ve been perfect but for the minor screen issues - the rest of the body looks brand spanking new. Given the scarcity of these mini iPhones I’d rather hold onto it as there’s no guarantee the replacement is going to be any better (unless Hybrid IT agrees to send a replacement device free of said issues. Upon receipt of which, I shall timely return this device. But only if seller agrees to cure first). Only time will tell whether Hybrid IT and the renewed premium promise lives up to its hype.","R3IR3OO9HAHZLK",,,,,,,,"2","Only time will tell - first time renewed premium buyer","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IR3OO9HAHZLK","Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2024","6130","203",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Starlight, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed Premium","B09LKXHWCF","Size","128GB","Color","Starlight","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed Premium"

The weird issue is that it didn't connect when I put my SIM card in, so I went to the AT&T store. They told me that the phone was flagged as stolen so my phone number was suspended! Luckily they were able to re-set my account (after two tries) and the phone is now working as expected. Love this size iPhone - it's actually even slightly smaller and lighter than the iPhone 8 it's replacing! Update: the stolen phone kept having connection problems and suspending my phone number. So I returned that one and got another. Sadly, this next one is at 90% battery health - it's what Amazon promised, but I was hoping for better since the first one was 100%.

I've been using it for 5 months, with apple's True Tone setting switched to ""off."" The display is dim. The keyboard can't be typed on, only swyped on. When the brightness is set to ""automatic,"" in a room with stable light, the screen brightness changes. It gets dark, then back to dim, repeatedly, because the aftermarket screen's light sensor is 💩. Apple's own diagnostic program confirms my light sensor diagnosis. I can only use 1 finger to ""swype"" because whenever I type with 2 fingers, the shoddy aftermarket screen makes the keyboard double, triple, and quadruple-type letters. Apple's settings to prevent double-type are useless against this hardware. The dead giveaway that there's something wrong with this display assembly (aside from diagnostic apps) is that when holding down the ""thumbs up"" button in Messenger to enlarge the thumb, the thumb stays small. The screen software and hardware can't register a long screen touch. Even though using this phone every day is an exercise in patience, it still gets 2 stars for functioning poorly. The replacement logic board and replacement battery still function for receiving calls, browsing the web, and checking email. Typing is a complete waste of time, though.

The first phone I got took an hour to set up because the touch screen registered every 3rd touch and had the screen reader enabled. I tried to use it for a week and tweak it to see if the touch screen issue was a weird quirk or if I could find a setting that fixed it. No dice. The phone was trash. The battery health was also at 78%. This is not the 80% advertised, and anything less than 80% can lead to a myriad of issues according to Apple reps. So, I'm returning that. Like a fool, I ordered another one because this seller has good reviews and I probably just got one of a few bad phones, I guess? No. I'm not sure how this seller has stellar reviews because this new phone, while the screen works (literally the lowest possible bar to set for a modern phone), the battery health is 76%. Again, below the advertised ""guarantee"" on battery life. I don't normally feel compelled to leave bad reviews, but, if I'm paying hundreds of dollars for a device and I get burnt twice, it's hard not to. Luckily, the refund wasn't disputed, but I've been out of a phone for over a week because of this lousy ""refurbisher."" Customer service told me to take a picture of the phone before I sent it back.

There were two small scratches on the screen right out of the box. There were noticeable scuffs along the edge of phone which you could easily see from a few feet away. The battery was at 95% but it drains suspiciously quickly (I’ve lost two percent just writing this review.) The phone isn’t usable for that reason alone. Not worth the extra money for a “renewed premium” phone. Not even worth the money period because of the battery reason, honestly. I know the mini doesn’t have a huge battery to begin with but the speed at which it drains is insane. This is after I’ve turned off all background refresh by the way.

There are many scratches along the edges and it looks like the screen has been replaced, with dust on the edges of the phone. I was not expecting stellar results, but a bit more disappointed than expected. I really wanted a 13 mini because of it's size and basic functionality and would have bought a new one if I could. The phone itself is nice and I wish Apple continued it. I don't care about a pro camera, I want a phone to actually fit in my hand. I will need to see how it holds up for longer, but as of day 1, the software works well and fast. Battery Capacity is 85%. Around 2 hours of music, and light use brings it down to 86%, but I am not too worried about it since I am always near a charger. It came with a 3rd party 15-watt charging port, cable, and 2 SIM tools (way more than what Apple gives you nowadays lol). Overall, you just have to be lucky to get a good phone. But I'd say it's worth the chance if you need something economical or are desperate for a iPhone 13 mini.

I recently bought an iPhone 13 mini from the Amazon Refurbished Store via Woot (via also Kiss Electronics??). I received the phone in the mail yesterday. I was very excited for this new phone, but upon unpacking the product concerns were already starting to come up for me. The Amazon packaging was normal, but the box inside was flimsy and the phone was very loosely packaged. There was about 4 inches of room for the phone to freely bang around in while traveling all the way to my address. Then I noticed that the seller of the phone was not who I had expected. I had thought Woot was the seller- in reality Woot was the storefront but there was no transparency as to the source of the actual phone itself. The seller was Kiss Electronics, which I found by reading the brochure in the package. Some research revealed that this seller is largely mistrusted and has a bad reputation. Most importantly, the condition of the phone was not refurbished- the refurbished claim was a huge lie. The camera lens has a deep crack and the speaker is blown with a hole in one of them. Upon further inspection it looks like someone took the SIM removal tool and poked a hole into one of the bottom speakers. The phone sounds pretty bad, so I think the damage is internal as well. The battery health is at 84% which was expected, but today when I took it off the charger and let it sit idly with the screen turned off, the battery percentage dropped by 15% in the span of an hour. I can't trust this phone, and I don't trust refurbished smartphones from Amazon because of this experience. The phones are pretty hit or miss, and unfortunately mine was a miss- definitely not worth the $400 gamble. Here's to hoping this return goes as planned. Save yourself the trouble- don't buy a refurbished phone from Amazon.","R3FJEPRPA1O7ZG","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61bU5jOROPL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61rV6agkg5L._SY88.jpg",,,,,,"6","Refurbished was a lie","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3FJEPRPA1O7ZG","Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2024","6130","179",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Pink, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B09LKXHWCF","Size","128GB","Color","Pink","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

I sent it back, they lost it (or someone stole it in the warehouse or whatever), and I had to fight with them 6 weeks to get my money back (despite having proof of arrival). Beyond that is the review of the phone itself. Well, that might be a little pointless because everyone already knows if they like iPhone or not. This is my first one and I am really disappointed. Whatever clarity and smoothness of design Steve Jobs originally intended for these things has worn away over the years until the interface is a clunky mess. Little things like, say, putting the LONG settings menu in alphabetical order are impossible. Plus, using tutorials online I had to spend 90 minutes shutting off to less than 15 secret ways it monitors and reports your every activity. They already charge SO much money for these, but want to make money off every inch of your private usage as well. One of the biggest downsides is no little blinking light to tell you when you have a text waiting. Such a nice feature on Samsung. Has its upsides though. It is indeed tiny enough to easily fit into a jeans pocket. After 3 months usage the battery life is still really impressive. I mean I charge the thing like twice a week. The fast charge function is at least twice as fast as regular charging (of course you have to separately buy a more expensive charger). Facial renegotiation is decent (it has trouble when I am sleepy, which is annoying), but I would prefer fingerprint option. Camera is...fine. I mean I would rate it as exactly as good as my 7 year old Galaxy. No headphone jack, which means there will be a quality limit on any music broadcast from the phone (bluetooth compresses quality, the dirty secret of no-jack phones), but I think most people won't care.","R3ILWO1BLZIMOH",,,,,,,,"2","Really suggest avoiding Amazing renewed premium","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3ILWO1BLZIMOH","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2023","6130","179",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Midnight, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed Premium","B09LKXHWCF","Size","128GB","Color","Midnight","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed Premium"

Phone arrived missing a SIM tray, and with an aftermarket battery that was defective. Phone would not charge correctly, making the sound/bump like it was charging but not showing a charge icon. After letting it sit for several hours it would say 100% charged, but whenever I tried to set it up it would shut down and reboot multiple times, each time taking the battery back to 0% charge. I got in contact with Amazon initially for the missing SIM tray and was given a 50% refund on the item, so I ordered a replacement SIM tray and took the phone to a local apple store and had the battery replaced. Cost for SIM tray and OEM battery was about one fifty, so after the discount from amazon and the cost to fix the phone I about broke even. The phone itself is in fair to good condition. The screen is in perfect condition but the case has numerous dings in the metal around the charging port. Camera lenses are also in perfect condition. The phone was still very dirty when it arrived so I gave it a good cleaning and it's clear they never bothered to clean the charging port at ALL when they refurbed it as I evicted a whole family of dust bunnies out of there when I cleaned it. All in all the product offering itself was good, but the seller could have done a better job refurbing the product. 10/10 customer service by Amazon.","R38ZXQ8R672KTE",,,,,,,,"2","Inspect Carefully, Buyer Beware - Refurbished ""GOOD"" Condition","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38ZXQ8R672KTE","Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2024","6130","179",,,"Size: 256GB, Color: Blue, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B09LKXHWCF","Size","256GB","Color","Blue","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

The phone looks like it sustained decent damage to the back but then potentially the cameras were replaced. I'm not confident about the life of this device and what may have been covered up. I will change this review from 2 stars if the seller responds to any of my messages. Thus far I can't return it even though Amazon claims all kinds of things about their ""Amazon Renewed"" guaranteeing things. Thus far it is BS and I have had far better luck with tech purchased from eBays refurbished program. The battery has 83% health and based on Amazon's renewed grading scale that they clearly outline I would give this phone an ""acceptable"" rating not ""excellent"". I understand things like this slip through so my opinion about the ReCom/ Simple Cell Inc. seller and this phone are subject to change. Edit 02/04/24: After a long back and forth talking to both the seller and amazon in an attempt to return the device, the seller sent me a shipping label. It is currently in transit back to them and hopefully the refund process is simple. I would recommend purchasing this phone from a place like Back Market where they have convenient shipping and return policies and far better customer service for nearly the same price.","R3GL3370DTJSTP","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61j8I7Img8L._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,,"WATCH OUT - Excellently Dented Camera Housing","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GL3370DTJSTP","Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2024","6130","179",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Starlight, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B09LKXHWCF","Size","128GB","Color","Starlight","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

I would even argue the product was “acceptable “ based on Amazon’s description. Yet I paid extra for excellent. The screen has multiple shallow scratches, and a few that are very prominent and deep. The aluminum has multiple places where there are dents and scratches. The back glass has etching that may have been from a previous case. The description for “excellent” says it would be free of these things. In addition, while the battery life does meet criteria of >80%, it barely passes that mark at 82. Overall, the phone works well, good camera, speakers, no mucky buttons. But the dismal battery health and cosmetic imperfections are unacceptable in the “excellent” category.","RKLGMKZQKFQ3O",,,,,,,,,"Certainly not excellent","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RKLGMKZQKFQ3O","Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2025","6130","179",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Pink, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B09LKXHWCF","Size","128GB","Color","Pink","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

The battery health was at 88%, so above the 80% advertised, but I had hoped for more. The phone identifies that the screen is unrecognized - it's apparently not an Apple part - but it works fine and looks great, so that is acceptable. Overall a poor deal since they did not bother to confirm the phone actually was working before sending it to me.","R3L29II6P532VA",,,,,,,,,"Wifi not working, 88% battery health, minor scratches, new (non-Apple) monitor, returned it","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3L29II6P532VA","Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2024","6130","179",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Blue, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B09LKXHWCF","Size","128GB","Color","Blue","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

And I figured if anything was wrong I could contact Amazon. But when I got the phone I first noticed a slightly large scratch on the screen, and when I turned it on it had a battery warning saying it couldn’t read the percentage. So I called Amazon and they didn’t help at all, they contacted the company and they took two days to respond. Supposedly the battery was replaced which means the phone has lost its waterproofing, and the scratch is supposedly normal for the company. So I asked for a replacement because if I returned and bought again it was 100$ more expensive. Well they couldn’t do that for whatever stupid reason. So I’m stuck with this phone. The reason I put two stars is because the battery life and phone do work good. I just have to be careful to stay away from water. But the customer service was terrible!!!

A screen protector is a must. The Renewed Premium phone arrived in excellent condition and has given me no issues in six months of use. I recommend it. In detail: ---Preamble--- I didn't buy a cell phone until mid-2008, and didn't buy a smartphone until early-2019. Both decisions were provoked by starting a new job. I've never been a heavy phone user; I receive less than twenty-five texts from actual humans a year, and maybe a phone call every other month. I only use my smartphone for calls, texts, checking email/calendar, navigation, alarm, and on occasion, checking into events or to take pictures. My app usage is limited to train tickets. As a result, I don't need much from my phone. I like having something fairly powerful, so it will run smoothly for as long as possible before I have to replace it. I didn't want anything too expensive, which is why I ignored Sony's offerings. I wanted a decent support cycle, which is why I ignored the Zenfones. I wanted something with reliable HW, which is why I didn't go with a Pixel. I wanted it to have WiFi calling/texting. I specifically wanted something small and compact, as my main complaint about my prior smartphone was how large it was. I would have replaced it earlier, but it was an Android and since the demise of the Sony Xperia Compact line there were no US-market small Android smartphones produced by anyone. I didn't want to make the transition to the Apple ecosystem, since this would be my one and only Apple device, so I dragged my feet even for a year after my old phone stopped voluntarily connecting to the cell network. Eventually I decided that I spend more time carrying my phone around than using it, and therefore form factor was more important than OS. ---Review--- I would never have purchased this at its original retail price, but it was definitely worth it at $450, particularly with the Amazon Renewed Premium Program. It arrived in a condition indistinguishable from new, at least to my eye. Setup was easy enough, though despite assertions otherwise the automated process of moving Android data to the Apple was not perfectly smooth and I had to make a number of adjustments after the fact. As a result of making this transition, I still run my Google apps on the iPhone - Authenticator, Calendar, Mail, and Maps in particular. I don't plan on changing those any time soon, but it does introduce some confusion into the workflow on the phone. For current Android users, there are some significant downsides. The loss of the ability to customize the environment is painful, even after six months. I am fairly technically capable and so appreciate the ability to make minor tweaks and adjustments to everything, and iOS constantly fights you on this. I would like my small icons back, and my ability to arrange them as I see fit. The lack of robust gesture/tap support, and limited gadget/widget customizability means you need to spend more time navigating than before. iOS's reputation for a janky file system presentation is well deserved, it can be hard to tell where files are going or have gone. In a non-Apple environment, HEIC complicates file storage and backup, though there are workarounds. The messaging app, for who knows what reason, doesn't have an archive option and just lists every conversation you've ever had in one long list on the main page, and requires an extra tap after the swipe to delete anything. There's no easy way to skip or snooze all alarms. All things I can put up with, though for the first month I was rather stroppy. I adapted to the UI quickly, but again I only use very few functions on the phone in my day-to-day life. I was able - with some frustration - to pair a set of Samsung Galaxy Buds, though you can only configure them through an Android device. Build quality seems excellent; however, do not take this phone out of its package unless you have a screen protector waiting for it. I was uncommonly gentle with this thing for the four days I was waiting for the protector to arrive, storing it in a pocket which had a clean cotton handkerchief padding the screen, and I -still- ended up with a significant enough scratch that it is still visible under the screen protector in direct sunlight. Don't risk it. HW and SW performance in contrast is flawless. I agree with the common sentiment that the iOS experience is very smooth, though I may be biased on account of my previous phone being on its way out at the time of transition. Battery life for me is probably two days and well into the third. That sounds good, perhaps, but my screen-on time is very low - I'm guessing between zero and ten minutes a day, with most of it on the low end, the only exception being during navigation. It is not unusual for multiple days to pass where my only interaction with my phone is to turn off the alarm. I would expect longer battery life under such circumstances, but I suppose that so long as it lasts all day it doesn't really matter. Lastly, I would say the sacrifice for the form factor was definitely worth it. I keep my phone in a cargo pocket and it is much lighter and less bulky now, especially when crouching down. 100% worth prioritizing that feature. ---Conclusion--- Like I said above, if you are like me - you are someone who doesn't need a lot of screen real-estate, power, or extensive battery life, but still wants to have the full functionality of a smartphone for irregular use, this is probably the best choice on the market. It was worth the transition from Android and the ongoing annoyance of Apple's eccentricities of design. I would recommend it, and will consider getting the next iPhone Mini, if Apple ever releases one.","RFM7HSCXY5YAK",,,,,,,,"29","Probably one of the most practical options out there","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RFM7HSCXY5YAK","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024","6130","275",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Midnight, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed Premium","B09LKXHWCF","Size","128GB","Color","Midnight","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed Premium"

The phone itself looks to be in great physical condition, no dents, chips or scratches observed. After having a using the phone for several weeks, I have noticed that although the phone does heat quickly, the battery life has improved considerably. Perhaps it needed to recharge first after delivering. It no longer charges as slowly and seemingly doesn’t die as quickly.

As far as I can tell, I got exactly what I ordered so I'd say it's worth the price I paid (under 500). Especially considering what new phones are going for now a days. It shipped quickly and arrived with it's own screen protector already applied (I have not removed it to check). Barely any scratches and no cracks. All the scratches are on the screen protector. For the body, the only wear I can see is around the camera (not on the lenses) where the ""frosted"" finish is, but that's not a problem for me. Both cameras work and it arrived unlocked and with the storage I wanted. Color looks great too. Battery looked good. I'm confident I can make 91% battery health work--I'm not a heavy phone user. I bought this with the intention to replace my current 13 mini when it eventually dies from being used for more than 4 years since I have a feeling Apple will never release a small phone again :( The one thing I'm not super happy about (not a deal breaker) is the iphone has iOS 18 -- yucky, but I'll just have to learn it (I've used iOS 15 for years). EDIT: Minus 1 star: still 4 stars--If I could make it 4.5 stars, I would So I finally removed the screen protector and found several scratches on the glass of the original phone screen. They are only really noticeable when the phone is off and in just the right angle of light. Some of them can be felt if you run your nail directly over them. None of them are so large/deep that they hamper the performance or display in a big way (at least for me) but I would personally categorize this level of wear and tear as ""good"" not ""excellent"" / ""like new."" Phone still works great and again, the body and cameras have barely any marks or visible wear and tear.","R2ANF5ZYGJAC1G","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613ouX9WxJL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SpPUWT+-L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61WvFQ4br0L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61iLIpmsFpL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61omQE9cHtL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/717+Trplh-L._SY88.jpg",,"10","Good buy - just pay attention to the condition before purchasing since stock changes all the time.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ANF5ZYGJAC1G","Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2025","6130","275",,,"Size: 512GB, Color: Product Red, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B09LKXHWCF","Size","512GB","Color","Product Red","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

Also the packaging was okay. With the phone itself everything worked, it came with a battery health of 86%, it works internationally with any carrier and it didn’t arrive with any scratch. Coming from a Samsung user the battery life itself it’s not as good as the phone that I had, however, it still lasts the whole day and I only need to charge it once. It arrived with a charging cable and block, but the block was damaged so I had to use a different one. It’s lightning and has a dual SIM. About the usage of the phone, everything works perfectly fine, the camera I’m amazed, the screen looks so good, the sound is just perfect and for any videos or audios the microphone has great functionality. I haven’t noticed any overheating. Something that I found interesting is the size of the phone, it really fits anywhere so the portability of it it’s a great plus. My friends and family have iPhones and you can really feel the difference and compatibility between an Apple ecosystem against an Android one. Overall I’m very pleased with my purchase, maybe what was more upsetting is the charging block being damaged but for everything else I’m having a great experience. Also the price and product are amazing, it’s almost like I bought something completely new with a nice deal. I’m really happy with it, definitely if someone asks me, I will definitely advise to buy refurbished!","R1XP2BA2J87A0R","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81GoOX2+jDL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81aN+fDtxHL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,"8","Overral 4/5 🌟","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XP2BA2J87A0R","Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2025","6130","275",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Midnight, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B09LKXHWCF","Size","128GB","Color","Midnight","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

When I received it I wasn’t all that impressed with the packaging. Simple cardboard box and surprisingly, not much protective material for the phone itself. It was simply put into a plastic sleeve and thrown in the box. It did come with a charging cube and cable. Anyways, the phone itself was in pretty good condition. Perfect screen. The back of the phone was also pretty perfect minus a few scratches. The perimeter of the phone however had some damage but again, nothing awful. My issue begins when I try to switch my SIM card from my old phone to this new phone. Turns out the phone I got was originally bought in China which wouldn’t be a big deal but my phone carrier is having connectivity issues. It’s completely fine on WiFi but I’m not always connected to WiFi. Either way I decided to test it out and I am indeed having connectivity issues. So, unfortunately, I will be returning this phone for that reason. I bought from the seller Woot and have decided to try buying a phone from them again once my refund is processed so I will update once I receive the newly ordered phone. — update — So I opted to instead buy from Amazon directly. I didn’t want to risk getting another foreign phone and I went with the right option. Came in great condition. There is a small scratch on the screen itself (even though I bought in “excellent” condition, but it’s seriously not even noticeable unless im actively looking for it). Battery health is at 89% which is great. The back of the phone is perfect. Was a bit dirty when I first got it but nothing a little alcohol and qtips won’t help. So far it’s working great, no issues at all. The switch from my old phone was super easy. It came in a sort of vacuum sealed plastic instead of just thrown in the box. It did only come with a charging cable though, no block. If that matters. Overall, if the option is available I would go with buying from Amazon directly instead of a third party seller to avoid any issues.","R1EDGE6UGNN2VU",,,,,,,,"22","Not a domestic IPhone.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EDGE6UGNN2VU","Reviewed in the United States on September 24, 2024","6130","275",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Pink, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B09LKXHWCF","Size","128GB","Color","Pink","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

It's at 78% max capacity. It's still a much better option than a new phone. This is the third refurbished iphone I got. The first one, an 8 I got in 2019, lasted until now, almost 6 years. It's still fine except for the battery. I thought about just getting a new battery for it but I figured I would have to upgrade before long because of the OS or something anyway. I got another 12 from this seller exactly a year ago but the battery in it was bad enough that I just returned it and used my original 8 for another year on the same battery. Anyway, it seems like they're a great deal, even if I need to replace the battery sooner. My first one worked just fine and I hope this one will be too. I must have replaced the battery in my 8 at some point, but I can't remember for sure. I can tell this battery isn't new, but it's not bad.

I would entirely prefer a pixel or Google phone over Apple but seeing as how they haven't made a phone smaller in the past 15 years I just can't bring myself to do it. My disdain for large phones outweighs my disdain for Apple as a company so I'm very thankful they've made a miniature phone and I wanted one for quite some time. I've heard good things about this refurbishing company so I decided to give them a shot. I was pretty nervous about the battery health thinking it might be in the low 80s or 70s and I'd have to return it to get a new one if that were the case but after receiving it today the battery health is over 90! The back of the phone is nearly blemish free save a minor chip on the edge. The metal rim of the phone is nearly blemish free save a minor knick on the top left corner. (Photo included) The cameras glass is looks great but the aluminum rings around them definitely have several blemishes and scratches although this is aesthetically hardly noticeable and functionally irrelevant. (Photos included) Unfortunately the screen does have several small scratches on the left and right sides in the middle and top. While the scratches on the screen are nearly unnoticeable when the phone is on they are worrisome as I am very meticulous with using screen protectors and keeping my screen clean. I will attempt to put a screen protector on it to see if they go away, if they do not or are still noticable with one on I may return it for a different one, although I do run the risk of getting one with a lower battery health because 91% is pretty good! I'm certainly hoping to keep this, I hope the screen protector fills the cuts that the phone has.","R3E9S2Q1MAKQ54","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6103gD6bVAL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/614jn68NEcL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61l7DHEbPfL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/718skh7d54L._SY88.jpg",,,,"8","Minor scratches on screen but battery in good shape","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3E9S2Q1MAKQ54","Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2024","6130","275",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Starlight, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B09LKXHWCF","Size","128GB","Color","Starlight","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

No major scuffs, although I saw a minor nick on the bottom corner of the phone. I wish the battery health was better, but it clocked in at 85%.

DEFECTIVE UNIT: - Service would cut out - Bluetooth didn’t function (wouldn’t let me connect) - NFC wasn’t functioning. The first phone cam on time. Everything worked fine until the quick share feature didn’t work, I initially didn’t pay much mind to it and set it up regardless. I instantly get an alert that apple pay may not be usable on the phone, also didn’t pay too much mind to it until I tried to make calls or send texts. Service would stay on for around 1-2 minutes before cutting to no service. Restarting, resetting network settings, and resetting the phone completely did not fix the issue. The bluetooth also didn’t work on the original unit I received. I requested an exchange the same day, wiped the phone, removed my apple account and shipped it back. The seller shipped the replacement a few hours after I dropped off the defective unit. EXCHANGED UNIT: - Everything works flawlessly - Battery Health at 95% - No issues with the phone currently. Overall, beware of receiving a defective unit, things like this happen, but I am very thankful for the easy exchange process, as getting a replacement was not a hassle.","R350EJ1T3J8M7L",,,,,,,,"9","BUYER BEWARE: Some units can have issues.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R350EJ1T3J8M7L","Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2024","6130","275",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Blue, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B09LKXHWCF","Size","128GB","Color","Blue","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

It's scratch and dent free, everything works as it's supposed to, and even the battery health is in a perfect 100% condition!! However, there are couple minor things I gotta point out: 1) The price difference between a brand new 13 mini (from official Apple store) vs. this refurbished unit is only about $50-$60. For a phone at this price point, I don't think many would care to pay a little bit more for a brand new one. I was lucky to get such a nice clean unit with a perfect battery, but if I have received one with a not so good battery (<90% health), I would definitely return it and get a new phone instead to save the hassle later, as my experience told me a less than 90% battery is pretty much half-dead already and frequent charging is required, guaranteed. Replacing the battery itself will cost you more than $60 for sure, at least before mass-produced aftermarket ones come out. 2) The shipment was packed without any hefty insulation. It was shipped with a small USPS priority box and the phone was in the box without much insulation protection. If I shake the box the phone would freely rock up and down, and I could tell a careless drop or if the postal worker toss around this package the phone would be damaged in no time. Fortunately mine was doing just fine after traveling from IL to TX. Hoped they could at least wrap the phone with a few more layers of bubble wrap of some sort to protect the merchandise.","RTXQRAX6WC3CR",,,,,,,,"53","Basically brand new, can't tell it's refurbished...

The overall condition of the product such as the appearance, battery status, and performance is good. The product comes with a charging cable, adapter, SIM slot separation pin, performance testing warranty, and activation method manual as shown in the picture. The genuine box is not included, but it was neatly packaged in a plain box, and the packaging was in good condition. The appearance of the product is generally good as mentioned earlier, but there are adhesive marks and slight scratches around the screen as shown in the attached photo. It seems to have been replaced due to a broken screen. I expected a better condition as I purchased a premium product, so I'm a little disappointed in this aspect. However, there is a clear advantage in terms of price, so I recommend purchasing it for consumers who can be satisfied with the product condition described above.","RON1GWRLXUQOO","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/517T7Rg6yRL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51V+CrBjTXL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51opaSDMVCL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51visHjVZCL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SOVG8INUL._SY88.jpg",,,"11","Good condition, fair price","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RON1GWRLXUQOO","Reviewed in the United States on March 16, 2023","6130","275",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Midnight, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B09LKXHWCF","Size","128GB","Color","Midnight","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

That phone had been a workhorse, had essentially functioned perfectly for years, and had been the phone I was planning to keep as long as possible rather than having to adopt the giant glorified IPads Apple markets as phones nowadays. So this seemed like a good solution— after all, you can’t buy a new iPhone 13 mini anymore. But I’m here to tell you, Amazon shoppers, I’ve had this phone less than a week, and it’s a disappointing purchase. First off the display is smaller, and there’s a black band all the way around the screen’s usable real estate— something google tells me is the result of a non-Apple display being installed. It is annoying because the old 13 mini used every millimeter of the display to make it seem like my screen wasn’t discernably smaller than the behemoth super sized iPhones. But this one— with the black border— absolutely feels significantly smaller. The screen is also noticeably less responsive and freezes up frequently. Couple all of this display BS with worse battery life than I had with my three year old 13 mini (which had never had its battery replaced), and it becomes clear that the seller is taking these discarded phones, outfitting them with substandard non-OEM aftermarket components, and selling them for way more than they ought to be worth. I thought this was going to be, in effect, a new phone. Don’t be as naive as I was.","R3Q7EHYSMACQRN",,,,,,,,"10","Substandard aftermarket replacement components","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3Q7EHYSMACQRN","Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2025","6130","545",,,"","B09LKXHWCF",,,,,,,,

On day 80 I went to set the phone up and noticed a small chip on the metal bezel, also the SIM tray removal tool was missing. After turning on the phone to check the ""guaranteed healthy battery"" which states the battery capacity to be at a minimum of 80%. The phone said the ""maximum capacity"" was at 79% and there was a message saying ""Your battery's health is SIGNIFICANTLY DEGRADED. An Apple Autheorized Service Provider can replace the battery to restore full performance and capacity"". After 2, 1 hr phone calls with Amazon support(they were helpful and kind) I ended up having to return the phone(WholeFoods return only, major inconvenience for me, why not UPS???) and buy another one.

Description said that the battery capacity would exceed 80%, which is untrue as evident by the attached screenshot. Main reason for replacing my phone is that the old phone battery is so terrible. Even at this point in writing my review (doing so on the iPhone 13 mini just purchased) I’ve gone down from 71% to 68% charge in just these few minutes. Very disappointed. Scratch on phone screen as seen in picture isn’t terrible but is also still noticeable at arms length (another untrue statement in the description). The marks around the charging port and on/off button actually came off after cleaning the phone. So just a heads up that the phone might come a bit dirty, be sure to wipe off! Lastly I think im noticing lag or “ghost typing” with the keyboard. I just came from the iPhone SE which is nearly the same size phone/keyboard so I should be able to type just as easily but am experiencing an abnormal number of typos. Not super sure if there’s another explanation for that one tho. I’m now at 66% finishing this review, ugh.

When it arrived, it was mostly as expected. The phone it self, I would describe in ”ok” condition. I was able to see three or 4 scuffed and worn areas around the bezel. The screen had obviously been replaced, more on that later. The charger and cable are complete junk, I didn’t even bother removing it from the package. On to my issues with this phone. As I mentioned, the screen has been replaced. It is not an Apple screen. This is obvious by appearance and function. The screen is not completely flat, the edges are particularly poor. So poor, that a glass screen saver will not sit flat and adhere. If I can attach photos later, I will, it’s very noticeable even in a photo. The touch is not as responsive as OEM. The pressure sensitivity doesn’t function well either, especially the sides when trying to press on a scroll bar to quickly scroll down a page. On to the most disappointing part. The battery. It arrived with 90% battery health. I was hoping for more, but this is within specs of what the description was, so I don’t hold this against anyone. However, it’s obvious that the battery has also been replaced because the performance is dismal. It discharges at an odd rate has poor battery life and charges sooooo painfully slow! I have turned off all efficiency charging options and tried multiple tests. I have let it sit on a strong cable charger for an hour, just to have it go from 6% to 10%. In short, based on this one purchase, I would say purchase with caution. The good thing is, it has a 90 day return policy. This one will be returned in the very near future.","R14UM5Y61WIAB7",,,,,,,,"20","Not satisfied with this phone purchase","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14UM5Y61WIAB7","Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2024","6130","545",,,"Size: 256GB, Color: Starlight, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B09LKXHWCF","Size","256GB","Color","Starlight","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

So I returned and bought a 2nd iPhone 13 mini again from Hybrid IT, this one in acceptable condition, (to see maybe I'd get a phone that didn't have the screen replaced and would at least accept a screen protector). The same issues! The battery health says Service, 79% max capacity and the screen protector will not seat properly. Hybrid IT says they will refund the cost of me going to Best Buy or the apple store to get the screen replaced myself, after I go pay for it myself and send them the receipt. I think the thing is somehow their company has received 99% positive, yet both of the purchases have issues.

In every case, the number was briefly recognized but then quickly reverted to a non-recognition status. They confirmed that the phone was not restricted and that the number was not blacklisted. Although their diagnosis wasn’t fully conclusive, the issue was clear: the phone would not accept my SIM card number, nor any other SIM card. I ultimately returned the phone, hoping to receive a refund. The entire experience was frustrating and a considerable waste of time trying to troubleshoot the issue.","R3CF1PB9CM8BSX",,,,,,,,,"New Phone Refused to Recognize eSIM or Physical SIM – Had to Return It","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3CF1PB9CM8BSX","Reviewed in the United States on May 15, 2025","6130","545",,,"Size: 256GB, Color: Green, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B09LKXHWCF","Size","256GB","Color","Green","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

There were visible signs of wear on the body, the black paint near around the corners had chipped off, and there were some weird greasy imprints on the power and volume buttons that I tried to clean but did not get off. The phone looked dusty and the front speaker grill was buried under a ton of ear wax, gunk, and Heaven knows what else! From the inside, it was even worse. The battery health was at a shocking 79%, which was comical considering the whole selling point of the ""Premium"" condition iPhones is their 90%+ battery health. Not to forget, the charging port was also defective, as I had to position the device in a weird way to get charged properly. My bottom line is that a phone like this barely fits in the ""acceptable"" condition, let alone ""premium."" It was a very disappointing experience.

TWO HOURS later, the carrier tech support said the ""unlocked"" phone I bought was restricted to Verizon PREPAID wireless and there was nothing they could do. Back it goes! Only AFTER you start a return does Amazon state that they will refund your purchase 30 days after the phone is received back, but allow 7 days for bank processing. AND you have no options to return it, except to wait for UPS to pick it up. Who in the heck has a business day to sit around waiting for a UPS guy??? I regularly drop items at my local UPS store, which is a few minutes from the house, but this is not an option for returning the phones. Now I am a prisoner, trying not to miss UPS so that I can start the 40 day clock ticking on getting my money back. Not everyone out there has endless supplies of money to be able to buy another phone while waiting this ridiculous amount of time for a refund.

Bought this for my wife mid march 2024. Three months later just outside the return window, the camera stopped working and the flashlight stopped working. The battery and screen were not genuine apple parts when we got the phone but hoped it wouldn’t be a big issue. We took it in to the Apple Store to see if we can fix it but they said it was more than just the camera and flashlight. She’s kept it in a case, hasn’t dropped the phone or been rough with it, but they said the screen is starting to come off and the sensors are not working for both front and back camera. Face ID isn’t working either so it’s a pain to always enter passcode. We expected this phone to last a few years (or two) not a few months…. Reached out to support today to see if they’ll help relieve such a poor experience with a phone that I’d say really isn’t up to refurbished “excellent” standards, especially for the price.

This caused air bubbles to form under every screen protector I tried. When I contacted them to have it replaced, they said I must first return the phone before they could send me a new one. I explained that this would leave me without a phone in the meantime, but they said there was no way around it. Reluctantly, I’ve been using the phone for three months now, but now the camera module has sunk in—it’s recessed compared to how it should be. This happened even though my phone case is perfectly intact! This seller clearly refurbishes devices just enough to make them work temporarily and takes no responsibility for quality issues.

However, upon receiving the item, I was disappointed to find that the battery health was only at 80%, despite being advertised as excellent. When I reached out to the seller about returning the product due to this discrepancy, I was assured that the return label was in order. Unfortunately, after testing the phone for a few days, the battery health further deteriorated to 78%. It became evident that the seller was using the ""excellent condition"" label to charge premium prices while delivering subpar products. In conclusion, I advise potential buyers to be cautious when purchasing from this seller and to thoroughly inspect any product labeled as ""excellent condition"" to avoid falling victim to misleading descriptions and unnecessary restocking fees.","RCISGSE4H1L8O",,,,,,,,"6","Beware of Misleading Product Condition Description","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RCISGSE4H1L8O","Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2024","6130","545",,,"Size: 256GB, Color: Green, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B09LKXHWCF","Size","256GB","Color","Green","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

I believe I'm not going to do much ordering from Amazon anymore. The fact that the item is defective and the return process is troublesome has put me off, at least for big-ticket items. This might even lead to me canceling Prime.","RCN5ISNQLOEVP",,,,,,,,"6","Phone is defective","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RCN5ISNQLOEVP","Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2024","6130","545",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Product Red, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed Premium","B09LKXHWCF","Size","128GB","Color","Product Red","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed Premium"
