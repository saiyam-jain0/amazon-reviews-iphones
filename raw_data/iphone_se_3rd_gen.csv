It was an upgrade from an iphone 8 that finally got too laggy to tolerate. Unfortunately this phone had phantom touch issues straight out of the package. Right away out of the package, I noticed that the screen felt oddly tacky/sticky. My finger didn't glide over it as smooth as I expected for a touchscreen. Then, during the setup process, I almost couldn't even sign into my apple account, because the screen kept freaking out while I was trying to type. It will randomly think I am pressing somewhere on the bottom left 2 inches of the screen. Depending on the app I'm trying to scroll through, it will randomly click on youtube videos or ads, upvote comments, close the keyboard while I'm trying to type, etc. It's not constant, but does happen frequently, so far about a dozen separate times in the last 12 hours, and it lasts for several minutes when the issue starts. I have wiped off the screen with a screen cleaner spray and a microfiber cloth 4 separate times today to no avail. Several times when the issue happened, the screen looked spotless. I've gone into settings and disabled anything that looked like it could even maybe cause this, including assistive touch. Something I didn't notice until after the issue started: the screen of the phone has no cosmetic damage, however the aluminum on the right side, about an inch above the bottom of the phone, has some very obvious scuffs/gouges, including about a centimeter where the paint is scraped off, right where the screen meets the aluminum. Clearly this is where they pried the old screen off for replacement. Unfortunately this screen is a poor replacement. My iphone 8 was purchased refurbished too, but has not had phantom touch issues in the 6 years I owned it. I'm now going to have to transfer my apple account and cell service back to my old laggy phone, return this one, wait for my return to be received, then wait for a replacement to be shipped and hope it doesn't have the same issue. I was really looking forward to finally having a decent phone again.","R3FB2O1ZRU5266","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61-miTzs8AL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/616ATvJJcDL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61GaWyd3TZL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61y9aDkSLgL._SY88.jpg",,,,"4","Phantom touch issues in Renewed-Excellent phone","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3FB2O1ZRU5266","Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2025","3032","78",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Midnight, Size: 64GB","B0BDY71GRG","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Midnight","Size","64GB"

I got a very bad refurbish on this phone. The battery has lousy health and it appears that the battery was not replaced which is standard in a refurbished, the lightning plug doesn't seem right and it won't always accept a charge, and it's buggy on the cellular aspect where it sounds like you're underwater on your calls. It drops calls frequently sitting in the exact same room where I can use my mom's iPhone and hers is fine. It gets hot to the touch and stops working every time Apple rolls out of software update. It's a bad refurbish. You guys sold me a lemon. These phones are wonderful when they actually work, but I will no longer trust refurbished phones on Amazon because of this. It has been a headache and nothing but problems since I bought it. Everyone keeps telling me to return it, but I missed the window and deeply regret sticking it out.

Even when toggled to the ON position, the phone would recognize it as ON for a split second then switch to silent immediately by itself. Seems like the previous user either dropped it in water or pocket lint or sticky substance had gotten into that toggle switch area. I feel this doesn't deem the phone ""Used-Acceptable"". The phone was returned promptly but I haven't received a refund and it's been over a week after I returned it. The only Amazon return option for the seller ""WCell Renewed"" was UPS pickup.

There was visible damage and sharp edges around the slot. 2) The phone diagnostics were unable to determine if the battery was a genuine Apple part, was defective, or not installed correctly. 3) The lowest portion of the touch screen had very poor sensitivity, making it difficult to use.

However, the model I received has a noticeable raised edge all around the screen where it was replaced. The edges of the screen overlap the panel slightly, if you tilt the phone, things on the edge are blocked out. It's an unfinished edge- there's no way I'd trust this thing to be waterproof. It'll be more susceptible to chipping, and the Touch ID button feels sharp. It also comes in at 85% battery health, which isn't terrible, but isn't great either. The obvious screen repair and inattention to detail make me question what else may be replaced inside of this thing that I can't see. I bought from ELECTRONIC DEALS in Brooklyn. This doesn't really feel like it deserves the ""Excellent"" condition modifier it was listed as.","R175WS74UEXT0M",,,,,,,,,"Good value, but some issues with certain refurbishes","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R175WS74UEXT0M","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2024","3032","78",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: RED, Size: 64GB","B0BDY71GRG","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","RED","Size","64GB"

I had the iPod touch before that and used basic texting apps. Both of those devices I kept until they were on their last legs. I even replaced the battery in the 8 as it degraded hoping to keep it longer because of how long I'd had it and how much I liked it. I had my 8 for about 5 years before the battery started giving me problems and almost a year after I replaced it--so at least 5.5 years that thing chugged along. When I was due for an upgrade, I really didn't want to pay $1000, so someone I trusted recommended the SE. Why? Because, they said, it was supposed to be basically the iPhone8 but under a different name: same battery, same processor, same camera, etc. Great! I loved my iPhone8 up until it's wheezing end. I bought my SE in July 2022, now (November 2023) this thing is already slow and the battery has degraded to 88% of capacity--in less than 18 months! 88% doesn't sound too bad but I feel it every time I listen to a podcast for 20 minutes and the battery goes from 100% to 80% or less. About 4 hours into my day, it's at 50% or less. What I bought was a BRAND NEW SE. On Black Friday, I bought a iPhone 13 for Apple for about the same price I paid for the SE. Here's hoping it lasts more than a year (SE) and praying it lasts over 5 like my 8.","R1LJV6TRDWQSLB",,,,,,,,,"Don't Buy SE","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LJV6TRDWQSLB","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2023","3032","78",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Midnight, Size: 256GB","B0BDY71GRG","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Midnight","Size","256GB"

However, my journey with this phone turned out to be quite disappointing. Initially, the phone seemed fine, but as I started using it, I noticed a few concerning issues. The device intermittently failed to register touches, and it struggled to establish connections with other Apple devices like my AirPods and iPad. Due to these problems, I decided to return the phone. I must acknowledge that the refund process was prompt. However, I was surprised to find that the refunded amount was $20 less than what I originally paid. This discrepancy prompted me to reach out for clarification. To my dismay, they first justified the deduction as a ""shipping fee"" for valuable items. When I questioned this explanation, they quickly changed their stance, claiming it was a ""restocking fee."" Finally, when I pointed out that the item was labeled as ""free return"" and ""free delivery,"" they resorted to accusing me of not returning the charger and imposed an additional $20 fee. I want to make it explicitly clear that I returned the item within the specified time window, and I included all the original accessories. This unwarranted deduction, accompanied by the seller's inconsistent explanations, left me feeling frustrated and deceived. Writing this review serves as a warning to other potential buyers. Not only did I waste my time setting up and returning a faulty product, but I was also unfairly charged a ""shipping/restocking/charger fee"" despite complying with all return requirements. Please exercise caution when dealing with this seller, as my experience indicates a lack of transparency and integrity.

It was a renewed/excellent condition. Nowhere in the description did it say could be refurbished with non apple parts. When setting up the phone I kept getting messages Battery Unknown! Battery Issue! Besides it being almost impossible to set up with another cellular company, what is the safety of this phone? It is for my 90-year-old father who needed an iPhone with a button. I researched all sellers and thought this was the best one. But now I know I was wrong. Will this overheat? This should’ve been clearly disclosed in listing. Nowhere did it say this refurbished phone may have non Apple parts installed. I am hoping to hear from the seller. This is the first of many refurbished items I bought that was not accurately described. “Unknown battery” is a very important disclosure to make known to buyer.","R36QMU0NSY9W5G","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61fLf7COlML._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/713AIaC95XL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Re7zr0cqL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71T6VwE0KkL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71WcuJUlzkL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71tzqFF-ILL._SY88.jpg",,"9","Not refurbished with genuine Apple parts! “Unknown battery”","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36QMU0NSY9W5G","Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2025","3032","256",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Midnight, Size: 64GB","B0BDY71GRG","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Midnight","Size","64GB"

I tried to call support only to be disconnected. I researched and found out that many customers have had the same issue. If you want an iPod touch, it’s fine.

I had always had my eye on the iPhone SE since I liked the size of my 6S and the SE is identical in size. So I bought the refurbished SE. At first this iPhone SE Gen 3 seemed wonderful! However, after using for only a few hours, the touch screen began not responding to the touched area. In particular it became impossible to send a text as touching the Send icon on the right side of the screen would ""select"" as if I had touched to the left of that in the text entry area. Bottom line it was impossible to send a text manually. I researched online and tried all the fixes. Rebooting. Reloading software. DFU Firmware reload. Same issue. So back it went. It did not feel like a hardware issue.... seems like there is some software glitch that Apple has been powerless to resolve? So I went to the Apple store... bought a brand new iPhone SE Gen 3.... loving it so far! It would have been nice to get one that worked for half the price... but it was not to be this time.","R2MEFCXXJMGVB2",,,,,,,,"25","Suffered from iPhone Touch Disease!

I'd never done it before and hoped for the best with all the guarantees. I bought a Verizon phone and it came the next day (ultra fast). The phone was, as advertised, in excellent condition and it had perfect battery life--that's where the good ended. I took it to my local verizon store to activate, and, after over an hour of working with their team and phone customer service, I was told that the phone was not compatible with Verizon because it had been reported stolen and sold anyway. Because the phone was flagged in verizon's system, they paused my whole account for suspected fraud. It took another 30 minutes with customer service to get my original phone/phone line functioning again. Verizon told me the phone would not work with them. I very promptly returned the phone. I will not order used again online to save myself from headaches like these--trying to save the money was NOT WORTH IT IN THE END. I will update my review to add a second star once I've received my refund. Naturally given how this has gone so far, I'm concerned about that.

I then bought a military grade case for her after this incident. She dropped the phone a second time and the battery no longer is recognized by the phone. I have owned cheapo Motorola phones in the past that I dropped many many times, and nothing like this has ever happened; they were much more durable even with a non-militiary grade case.

She doesn't use it much so it's not like we needed to get anything expensive and new. This has done the job. After having it for a couple of months, I'm pleased with the purchase, the quality of the phone, and the parts or work that went into refurbishing it. The battery life has been exceptional, the wifi speed is great, there is no lag, the camera works great, and I've not had any regrets. All that said, you should not expect this to have the same performance as a new phone out of the box. It's overall what I expected, but neither was there anything that gave it a higher-than-expected rate. The battery performance remains high but the capacity has diminished a little more than I'd hoped. Probably an aftermarket rather than a OEM batter.

The only thing I would say is that I don't agree with its label as being labeled in ""excellent"" condition. I think, ""Very Good"" would have been more appropriate as there were a few small scratches on the screen, and some scuffs on the bottom. Other than that, my only other gripe is that the battery doesn't seem to hold a charge for very long. I have to charge it every other day, and I'm not a hard core cell phone user. It was unlocked as advertised, and overall it is a great phone. I'm coming from a Samsung Galaxy 10+ so the size is quite an adjustment for me, but I'm actually glad not to have that beast in my pocket now. I am worried about the life of the battery. It already seems at half life so for that I cannot give a full five stars.","RQVJWQKO876O5",,,,,,,,"8","It's Satisfactory","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQVJWQKO876O5","Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2025","3032","122",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Starlight, Size: 64GB","B0BDY71GRG","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Starlight","Size","64GB"

Got this as a secondary device. The phone is OK. I am not a fanboy of any kind, and it is OK for the secondary use case I need it for, but would not switch to it as my daily driver. I would recommend it to some of my friends who do not like change. They would probably like this more over a lot of Android innovations which are often cool and innovative but when they are not, they are annoying too. But once you have the power to customize your experience, it is hard to accept substandard solutions. The notification center is pure garbage. It is literally worst than it had ever been in android. Other UI/UX solutions are highly questionable too. I had to switch between 3 different places to change something about the sleep app. Lol, it was so stupid it was fun. Cannot quite believe this is a company known for user experience. I do appreciate the ability to remove many stock apps. Not being in apple ecosystem it is great to remove facetime and similar things I will never use. Google overreaching lock-in is annoying. Though I use custom ROMs to remove Google garbage, but that is not a solution for everyone. I really like that Apple lets me remove their trademark apps. I do not want to not use them. I just want them out. Big bonus points for that. Also love the ability to disable iMessage. I do not want my few iPhone-owning friends to know I have this device because they will send me social crap (aka videos) and now I have the excuse that when it comes as MMS it is un-viewable and I do not have to engage. They can always send it to me by email but they are to lazy tod o that, hehe. So disabling iMessage is a saver! VERY happy with it. Some people just do not understand you do not care about the latest new trends. Also love the physical button and the small size. Hate not having an aux jack and the non-universal power connector. Overall, I am OK with it for the excellent like-new renewed price of 50% off. If they keep making small, mid-range phones with physical buttons I might stay a customer for a long time. At full price, big screen, no button, it would be a no from me. Cannot see the appeal overall. It is a decent 4 stars for a person not locked to any ecosystem.","R12Z1GB80KERSB",,,,,,,,"9","Good enough.

I feel that ""renewed"" is a bit of a marketing ploy, because it's USED, plain and simple. I can see the marks where the previous user must have attached a lens over the camera, and there are faint ""in the pocket"" scratches on the screen. Thankfully these marks and scratches are not visible except in direct sunlight, so they do not interfere with the picture quality. The battery also seems to be in decent shape for a used phone. My theory is these phones are turned in for credit when people upgrade to the next latest-and-greatest phone. I wasn't impressed with how the phone was delivered to me with a totally drained battery. That and the OS was not properly reset. This was definitely not the same experience as buying a new phone from Apple. But again, I'm judging this phone with price in mind. As for the phone itself, I wanted a phone, not a tablet / phablet, and this phone is great in that regard. It fits wonderfully in my pocket, and yet it has all the capabilities of a larger phone. The phone is fast, responsive, runs the latest iOS, has a great camera, and supports the latest 5G cellular protocol. It feels good in the hand, and the signal quality is what I expect in my area. The funny thing is that I didn't want to upgrade to this phone (I was happy with my old Windows phone), but when my old phone stopped working, I had to get a replacement, and I'm kinda glad now because this phone is very good for what I'm interested in - phone, text, photography, mapping, hiking, etc. For everything else, I rather use my iPad.","R168ZZVLWFBVLJ",,,,,,,,"7","Definitely a used phone, but in decent shape for the price","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R168ZZVLWFBVLJ","Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2024","3032","122",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Starlight, Size: 64GB","B0BDY71GRG","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Starlight","Size","64GB"

Here's my review, with an emphasis on its performance as a travel companion: 1. Compact Design: The iPhone SE's compact size makes it an ideal travel companion. Its smaller form factor allows for easy handling and effortless portability, fitting comfortably in pockets or small bags. Despite its size, it doesn't compromise on functionality or performance. 2. Compatibility with Google Fi: Utilizing the Google Fi service on the iPhone SE enhances its value as a travel phone. Google Fi provides seamless connectivity and coverage across multiple networks, including international roaming options in many countries. This allows travelers to stay connected and avoid excessive roaming charges while exploring different destinations. 3. Performance and Software: The iPhone SE 3rd Gen delivers impressive performance with its A13 Bionic chip. It offers a smooth and responsive user experience, enabling swift app launches, multitasking, and smooth browsing. The latest iOS updates ensure that users have access to the latest features and security enhancements, making it a reliable device for travel. 4. Camera Quality: The iPhone SE's camera capabilities are noteworthy, especially for travel photography enthusiasts. With a 12 MP rear camera, it captures vibrant and detailed photos, even in challenging lighting conditions. The Portrait mode and Smart HDR features add depth and enhance the overall quality of images. Additionally, the phone's 4K video recording capability allows for capturing memorable moments in high resolution. 5. Battery Life and Charging: The battery life of the iPhone SE is decent, allowing for a full day of moderate usage during travel. However, heavy usage or extended periods of navigation and media consumption may require frequent charging. The device supports fast charging, which is beneficial for quickly replenishing the battery when needed. 6. Storage Capacity: The 64GB storage capacity may be limiting for some travelers who tend to capture a large number of photos and videos or download extensive offline content. Consideration should be given to managing storage and utilizing cloud-based solutions or external storage options for extended trips. Overall, the Apple iPhone SE 3rd Gen, paired with Google Fi service, offers a reliable and compact travel phone experience. Its small size, powerful performance, compatibility with Google Fi, and impressive camera capabilities make it a great choice for travelers. While battery life and storage capacity could be potential considerations, the overall package of features and functionality make it a solid option for those seeking a travel-friendly device.","R54RJFL2BFKZH",,,,,,,,"43","A Compact Travel Companion: Apple iPhone SE 3rd Gen with Google Fi","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R54RJFL2BFKZH","Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2023","3032","122",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Midnight, Size: 64GB","B0BDY71GRG","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Midnight","Size","64GB"

The only downside was that the charging block that the phone came with did not work. I emailed TetchyTech asking them to send me a new one and they replied within minutes stating they had sent me a new one! Excellent customer service. Just like the product description said, it came with a SIM card tool, a charging cable and a power block to plug the charger into an electrical outlet. The charging cable appeared to be a third-party cable, ANKER brand, but it fit into the phone’s charging port. Also, the cable seemed brand new! I’m excited about that because it should last a long time. The block was first-party, but had lots of marks and scratches, making it look dirty. The charging cable worked just fine, but the block that came with the phone did not work at all. I tested both the block and cable with multiple other parts and outlets and confirmed that it was the block that was broken. But like I said earlier, I emailed TetchyTech and they immediately responded and shipped me a new block. I was happy about that. If I didn’t already have a backup charger, I would be pretty upset with TetchyTech for giving me a broken charging block. So just be aware of that. The iPhone itself: Like new. Very small signs of use, all barely noticeable, including a tiny scratch on the back. Excellent job on the outside of the phone. Everything worked perfectly except that on 2 different occasions, both in the first week, the phone wouldn’t respond when I tried to unlock it and the screen stayed black for about 15 seconds. Then, it started working again. It hasn’t happened in the last week and a half or so, so I’m not too worried about it. The phone came 95% charged.","R1ONQYJR3JPMDT",,,,,,,,"25","Trusted Seller and Excellent Customer Service, but Came With Broken Charging Block","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ONQYJR3JPMDT","Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2023","3032","122",,,"Service Provider: Verizon, Color: Midnight, Size: 64GB","B0BDY71GRG","Service Provider","Verizon","Color","Midnight","Size","64GB"

It was 88. For it to be a good condition or acceptable condition that number will have been great, but at the end of the day, little disappointed with battery health. External aspect - Great, front seems brand new, on the back few minor scratches. Im a very detailed person, I think majority of people would not even notice those tiny scratches on the back. Internal - As I mentioned earlier, battery not great. Rest of it seems pretty good with just one day of use. At first, while setting it up it got a little warm, but was expected.

It’s much better even than newer devices from android at budget tier 5g. However, the network was absolutely horrific until I changed the network setting on it to 5G on. I was very unsatisfied with it up till that change. Apparently it has a major issue optimizing things around 5g signal so you need to just go all 5g or none. I had way too many connection drops and unacceptable latency with it until I found this out. Otherwise it’s 5 star for professional, im an independent contractor and the apps used to complete my work absolutely perfect in terms of the hardware and system like camera not lagging and the overall login and speed of use daily all day reliable.

Buyer beware about this, if you want battery life of at least 90% make sure you get a phone labeled as ""premium"".

Fortunately this was for my son and his previous phone was still usable during the whole ordeal. 1) First phone I received looked perfect, started the automatic migration, was looking good and then it told me it didn't have enough space. Looked on the Verizon site and it showed me it was a 64GB phone, not 128GB. Returned without issue. 2) Second phone I received looked good too, started the migration but it wouldn't activate. Turned out not to be a US version, it was tagged as ""Rest of World."" The eSIM functionality didn't work. I had Verizon send me a physical SIM card and we were able to get it activated. Unfortunately there was other functionality disabled as well, not NFC for ApplePay so you could add cards but not use it at a terminal. Also, GPS resolution was hobbled, completely useless for car navigation. Returned without issue, but much frustration before the return. 3) Picked one that was sold and shipped by Amazon, not sure if that made the difference but there was no problem with the phone. Overall it took a couple of months and each return/reorder cycle got more expensive — there was no replace option — so it wound up costing about $40 more then I had originally spent. All the phones were super clean, looked like new.","R1YMDAIKLMVZYM",,,,,,,,"3","Third time's the charm","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YMDAIKLMVZYM","Reviewed in the United States on March 30, 2025","3032","107",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Starlight, Size: 128GB","B0BDY71GRG","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Starlight","Size","128GB"

That is not the case with the phone I received. It has a sort-of ""mini"" overlay which is noticeably not the same since the resulting phone is thicker and depending upon how one holds the phone when using it as a phone, less comfortable than one might expect or have grown used to experiencing. One may have the disconcerting experience of having the edge of an earring encountering the edge of the stiff plastic overlay, The overlay is removable and there were no large scratches, Otherwise, the phone seems to work even if it now uses IOS 18 rather than the original version. I would have preferred the original version. IOS 18 has more of the latest IOS nonsense: ""haptics"" that are useless AND annoying, still more intrusion into one's personal life, and I couldn't transfer my music library -- the transfer from ios 17 kept failing in a bizarre manner. As usual, Apple now wants to know everything. It's my phone, not theirs. Actually, an iPhone 6 -- really -- is a better user experience mostly because the applications are smaller and more focused. In summary, the ""renewed"" phone is a disappointment since it doesn't have quite the same look-and-feel as an original. If you want or need a less-expensive phone capable of running IOS 18, this should suit your needs. It suits mine.","R3CF520S2VEN14",,,,,,,,"2","Not Nearly Sufficiently Well Done","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3CF520S2VEN14","Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2024","3032","107",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Midnight, Size: 64GB","B0BDY71GRG","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Midnight","Size","64GB"

My issue with the phone is that sometimes the touch on the screen stops working and I have to lock the phone and unlock it to get it to work. The phone is also a little slower than I was expecting, even for a budget phone from 2022. Browsing the internet is a little slow and I sometimes lose service in areas I didn’t before. When I try to use the gps it doesn’t work and has a hard time keeping track of my location. I will say if you really only want a phone for basic things then this is great.

But overall, even when you pay extra for ""excellent"" condition, seems like what you get is entirely up to luck. I have seen reviews saying they got a phone with 100% battery life left; mine only had 87%, and also had a crack in the glass screen in the top left corner, and the home button (and I am used to home buttons on iPhones) clearly was depressed/not flush with the screen such that it actually hurt my thumb to use because it would press down on the glass outline around the circle when pressing the home button. Overall, I would honestly rather shell out the extra money for a new model of the same phone, so at least I can feel like I'm going to get a few more years out of it.

We’ll see how it goes. ETA2: phone still didn't work. WDO (seller) told me I was out of luck, 'it worked fine for us'. It worked intermittently for us at best.

The bad part: Phone would not authorize on Verizon network. The Verizon reps were great and tried for about two hours to make it work. Level 2 support discovered that the phone had a ""Carrier Lock"" in place and would not allow Verizon authorization. Perhaps someone smarter could have found a way around this, but I couldn't. The redeeming part: Amazon quickly processed the return and my credit card refunded. If I was sure that the next phone would be unlocked I would probably buy from this vendor again.","R24TDI531LVJTX",,,,,,,,,"ALMOST Geat!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24TDI531LVJTX","Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2024","3032","107",,,"Service Provider: Verizon, Color: Midnight, Size: 64GB","B0BDY71GRG","Service Provider","Verizon","Color","Midnight","Size","64GB"
