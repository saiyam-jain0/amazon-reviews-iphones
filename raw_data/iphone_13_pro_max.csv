Got the Apple logo when I plugged it in to recharge. Also phone heats up when using for anything. Like right now I can feel the heat thru the back of the cover. Was expecting it to be at least near new for the price I paid. Am considering returning it. Additionally, I get a warning when trying to download apps from the App Store that the phone is already associated with a different Apple account (than mine) and I will not be able to download previous apps for 30 days if I transfer accounts. Transferred to my account anyways. Another thing is it will not do my facial recognition. It keeps telling me to lower or raise my phone and I follow the directions but it refuses to complete the process and tells me to try again later from the settings page and I have but I get the same thing over and over. It is so bulky and heavy. I will see how well a charge will last while using it then decide if it’s just an overpriced hand warmer. Nothing like my iPhone 8 + which I would have continued using if Apple didn’t make it impossible to accept the “new” terms and conditions in order to use my phones and iPads with iCloud! Companies that produce expensive devices like the iPhones should not just drop support of their products after a few years just to make you buy their new devices. Especially when the old ones work better. Anyone else experiencing this problem with their “old” Apple devices? Anyone know a workaround for the problem? I have tried going through the iCloud site to try to accept the terms and conditions but to no avail. We just upgraded our family storage to the 2Tb for all our Apple devices but now only our iPhone 12 will be able to use it! Elon needs to hurry up with the Pi phone; I would switch in a heartbeat!","R39SG2E3WYP0GM",,,,,,,,,,,,"Battery doesn’t even last past a day without even touching it!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R39SG2E3WYP0GM","Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2025","8819","187",,,"Size: 512GB, Color: Graphite, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B09LPK77YY","Size","512GB","Color","Graphite","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

The camera was slightly scuffed, but it's small. The phone came dirty, and the phone wasn't fully reset. On the phone, we found Arabian podcasts that were previously being listened to, a phone call from the united arab emirates, and holidays on the calendar app from their country. We noticed the battery charges a bit slowly despite being at 100% maximum battery life. And finally, the phone heats up quickly and hardly charges when being used. These problems are mostly small and are not huge issues, but they are worth mentioning, especially the fact that there was someone else's stuff on there.

The outside is in great condition, no marks or really anything that I’ve noticed thankfully. The phone is also performing pretty much as I imagine it should. However, there are 2 main issues that I have with it. The phone came with a battery health of 82%, which isn’t AWFUL, I suppose, but definitely lower than I would’ve liked, 90+ would’ve been good. The other is something that I found while watching a video that went to black, and that’s a bit of noticeable burn in. It’s not obvious, really, by any means, but those are some things that you could definitely expect when buying one of these. At the price that they’re listed at, I would expect a bit better for sure, but overall it’s not terrible.","R3KTVALZ7MTX77",,,,,,,,,,,,"Know what to expect!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3KTVALZ7MTX77","Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2024","8819","187",,,"Size: 256GB, Color: Graphite, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B09LPK77YY","Size","256GB","Color","Graphite","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

The bad: items were missing in the box, the charging cable, charger, and sim kit. I messaged Amazon who was going back and forth if they could even send me anything, but they decided to contact the seller even though it’s Amazon approved. The microphone is defective. Contacted Apple and they told me to bring it in, but all too often it’s going to be a mechanical issue as the video recording microphone works. This was my 1st experience buying through Amazon trusted refurbished devices, I’m deciding to go eBay or Apple themselves.

It stayed connected to Wi-Fi only and was never used with a SIM card—until now. When I finally inserted a SIM, I was shocked to find the phone blocked and reported as stolen by the previous owner. I immediately contacted Amazon customer service, hoping for help, but was told they couldn’t do anything since the return window had closed. I also reached out to Apple, but they confirmed there’s nothing they can do either. I reached out to the seller, completely unhelpful (tried multiple times, finally someone answered and instructed to send a message through Amazon), and the response was: “Due to the age of the order, we cannot help.” I even tried to file a formal complaint, but that option wasn’t available. asked customer service to file a complaint, they said they cannot! So now I’m left with an unusable phone that I paid full price for—essentially throwing it away. No support, no resolution. Just a lot of frustration. Buyers, please be careful. This is my third attempt to leave this review—my previous two never got posted. I’m shocked that I can’t even share my honest experience here after all that happened.","R3T2R2NZXREE75",,,,,,,,,,,"11","BEWARE – Phone Blocked & No Support from Seller or Amazon","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3T2R2NZXREE75","Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2025","8819","629",,,"Size: 512GB, Color: Sierra Blue, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B09LPK77YY","Size","512GB","Color","Sierra Blue","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

Woot said they can't help because it was bought on amazon. After a few times back and forth, Woot created a return label for the phone and said they will refund. So we sent the phone back, UPS tracking info shows the phone arrived on 6/24. Today is 8/6, still no refund. Woot won't respond anymore. I emailed and called. Woot just says they can't help. I have mentioned that Woot created the return label and we followed the instruction and returned the phone. They just say there's nothing they can help now. Woot says Amazon needs to refund. Amazon says the return label was created by Woot so they don't know where the phone is. One of the customer service person at Amazon then created another return label even tho we have explained that phone has been returned. Sooo much money and time wasted on this.

It was so bad that I had to play everything on speaker phone mode just to avoid the scratchy distorted sound.

However, the battery health is very bad, 80%, I just received the phone yesterday and set it up. The battery burned very hot when it was charging for the first time and burns hot during regular use without charging. Now, when using my new phone normally, the battery life lasts about three hours. I reached out to the seller yesterday but have not received any response yet. It’s a hassle for me because I have already transferred everything over to this new device, so any replacement would need to arrive before I return it so that I won’t be without a phone. Which I doubt they would be willing to do. It is crucial that for an IPhone to be considered in excellent condition, the battery health is 94% and above.

It came with 76% battery capacity and small slight scratches on the screen. The scratches dont really bother me, you hardley notice them. As for the battery, i came from a iphone 12 that would hit 20% just on my morning drive to work. So it also doesnt bother me, its better then what i had. As for the rest of the phone,the silver band is pristine, the back glass and cameras are also in great condition. This phone is only 3 years old almost 4 and was $1600 new when it was first released. I only paid 570. Im very satisfied and wont be upgrading for at least a few more years. Also just a fyi ( i didnt know this before) the iphone 13 was the last to have a physical sim tray which is another reason i wanted it, but when i was setting it up it gave the option to do a esim transfer.

I purchased the one labeled as refurbished excellent. The phone came with absolutely no scratch or dent at all and I deeply examined it. Transferring data from my iPhone 11 to this 13 pro max was very smooth ! The phone indeed came unlocked as I wanted . The camera quality is amazing and it even came with a piece of plastic on the screen. So far mostly everything met my expectations except the battery health , it came as 82% and I was honestly expecting 90% or higher. I must say tho that I fully charged the phone and it last almost the whole day. I am truly in love with my phone and when I’m upgrading I’ll consider this vender again .

I reached out to the seller and they did their best to help so I won’t really blame them for this inconvenience. The phone itself is great so far, I have yet to actually use it and switch over to it.

I recently purchased a phone from your store and opted for the best available option, which was advertised as being in “excellent condition.” While I am generally satisfied with the product, I do have one concern regarding the battery health. The battery capacity is currently at 93%, which, while still decent, does not align with my expectations for a device described as being in “excellent condition.” Typically, I would associate such a description with a battery health rating closer to 100%, especially given that I paid a premium price for this option. I understand that some wear and tear is inevitable, but when a device is marketed as being in “excellent condition,” I believe it should reflect that in all aspects, including battery performance. As a customer, I want to ensure I’m receiving the quality I paid for. Could you please clarify your standards for describing products as being in “excellent condition,” particularly when it comes to battery health? Additionally, I would appreciate that in a future. Thank you for your time and understanding.

The iPhone 13 Pro Max offers significant improvements in terms of overall performance and features compared to its predecessor. The A15 Bionic chip ensures smooth and snappy performance, and the camera system delivers exceptional image quality. The display is stunning with its vibrant colors and high resolution, providing an immersive viewing experience. The device's build quality is excellent, as expected from Apple, and the design is sleek and premium. However, coming from an iPhone 12 Pro Max with a battery health of 83%, I was hoping for better battery performance with the iPhone 13 Pro Max. Unfortunately, I was disappointed to find that the battery health of my new device was also at 83%. Considering the hefty price tag of the iPhone 13 Pro Max, I expected a better battery health out of the box. That being said, the iPhone 13 Pro Max does offer a longer-lasting battery compared to its predecessor. With moderate usage, I can comfortably get through a full day without needing to recharge. I hope that this battery health issue doesn't lead to the same battery problems I encountered with the iPhone 12 Pro Max, where it struggled to hold a charge effectively. Aside from the battery health concern, the iPhone 13 Pro Max is a powerful and feature-rich device that caters to the needs of tech enthusiasts and professionals alike. The improved performance, exceptional camera capabilities, and stunning display make it a top contender in the smartphone market. In conclusion, the iPhone 13 Pro Max offers an overall positive experience with its impressive performance and features. However, the disappointment lies in the battery health, which was the same as my previous iPhone. I'm hopeful that the battery life remains consistent and doesn't deteriorate rapidly over time. If Apple can address this issue and improve the battery health of their devices, the iPhone 13 Pro Max would unquestionably be a top-notch smartphone choice.","R3KHJTRZFMK0AN",,,,,,,,,,,"25","Good performance, but disappointing battery health","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3KHJTRZFMK0AN","Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2023","8819","311",,,"Size: 1TB, Color: Sierra Blue, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B09LPK77YY","Size","1TB","Color","Sierra Blue","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

Had I seen the phone ahead of time and handled it, I would not have paid so much for it. ""There will be no visible cosmetic imperfections when held at an arm’s length. There will be no visible cosmetic imperfections when held at an arm’s length."" This part of the product description is entirely inaccurate. There are visible imperfections when held at arm's length, most noticeably damage to the steel in the bottom left corner near the screen. There is also slight damage around the camera lenses, although this is not readily visible at arm's length. In addition to the visible damage, the button on the righthand side functions, but does not have the full range of travel that a new or like new phone has (I'm comparing directly to another iPhone 13 Pro Max I bought new). It's hard to sense sometimes whether you've pressed the button or not. Setting up the phone was an all-day, all-night, into the next day nightmare with it attempting to update to iOS 17.1 during the install process and failing multiple times during setup. It was on 3 month old software (iOS 16.5.1 (c). Once I finally managed to get it updated to iOS 17.1, I was able to wipe it (for the 4th or 5th time?) and then go through a normal setup process. I wish it had come with a more recent software version, that would have made setup easier. Battery life is excellent, its battery health is at 90%, which is exactly what I was hoping for with this purchase. All told, I'm pleased with the phone despite its imperfections, but in light of the imperfections and the age of the device, it was far more expensive than it should have been.","R2B9HNS2Q3MT8M",,,,,,,,,,,"75","Not as refreshed as I'd like","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2B9HNS2Q3MT8M","Reviewed in the United States on October 30, 2023","8819","311",,,"Size: 512GB, Color: Alpine Green, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B09LPK77YY","Size","512GB","Color","Alpine Green","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

Went back and forth before deciding to buy it. Quantity and selection is relatively limited as well as pricing. It was a decent price, very similar to what you find on Apple's website for refurbished iPhones. The item came was shipped with 3 day delivery but came 1 day earlier! :) Signed and opened the package for inspection somewhat nervously. Was surprised to find that the iPhone 13 Pro Max was in relatively pristine condition. No scratches to the screen, to the back or to the side. One of the camera lenses had a slight scratch on the outer rim but doesn't affect performance (see picture). Battery capacity was at 96%, which was good, but fell to 95% after charging. It's Unlocked as noted... 'Carrier Lock... No SIM restrictions'. :) Also included was a short lightning cable and a generic 5W charger, which the latter was useless. The entire phone and box had a slight cigarette smell. Wipe down the phone with soap and water then dry with a microfiber cloth. It still has a slight smell but at least it's been cleaned. What was Missing was the SIM removal tool! Luckily, I had a spare SIM removal tool available. Had to restore and reset the iPhone twice before the clean iOS took effect. It originally included iOS 15.6 which I was hoping to keep and try to update to 15.7.1 but Apple stopped that update and is now forcing newer devices to update to iOS 16.x, currently 16.2! After that, used iTunes for Windows to copy over all the media files to the 13 PM since the restore/reset function literally wipes the iPhone clean. Finally, got lucky and found a Speck clear case on clearance along with a glass screen protector, both at discounted prices, at a nearby Walmart! ;) Currently it's working fine.

After I talked to amazon they were able to compensate for my time and took responsibility. Will continue to buy items sold and shipped by Amazon (below my previous review) I specifically looked for refurbished phone sold and shipped by Amazon hoping would be better than third party sellers. After first use, I noticed that the phone would not receive incoming calls (they would go straight to voicemail). Called service provider and they couldn't help. Called Apple support and they were struggling to understand what it was. Ultimately they said it's either a firmware issue or there is a remote possibility it's hardware problem. I performed update and restore from iTunes and the problem appears to be fixed now. I will keep testing over the next 90 days and decide if return the item or keep it. Shame I had to waste almost a day on the phone and looking for support. Amazon should have tested firmware and software were properly loaded.

The camera is great, the interface is simple to use, and call quality is definitely on par when compared to top-tier android flagship devices. The battery life is okay. It can last an entire day on light usage, but in my opinion, I am not satisfied with the battery life. When compared to its competition, android devices in general just have more battery life. With the apple fast charger, charging the phone is much improved, but is still far behind android. The best thing I like about the iphone is the screen design. The screen is completely flat, so it helps when deciding what screen protector to put on it. I do not like it when the screen wraps itself around the phone. It makes the device much more delicate in my experience. I think the iphone is a solid all-around smartphone. The phone is specifically designed to work within the Apple ecosystem and obviously does a solid job of doing so. I do believe iphones are way over priced, but its a supply and demand market so my opinion will not resonate with every single customer. In my experience, there are android devices that can perform in a similar manner at half the price. Solid device, not a must have unless it is something that you actually need.","RB52W5M9ADGBA",,,,,,,,,,,"19","You need to use a case with this phone at all times","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RB52W5M9ADGBA","Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2023","8819","311",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Sierra Blue, Service Provider: AT&amp;T, Product grade: Renewed","B09LPK77YY","Size","128GB","Color","Sierra Blue","Service Provider","AT&amp;T","Product grade","Renewed"

I’ve always had good experiences, and never had any issues. This time, the phone arrived, everything was perfect. Tested all the functions and everything worked. However, I noticed a few hours later that the speakers sounded a little “off”. I couldn’t put my finger on it but I knew something was up. I had an iPhone 13 Pro (not the max) and those speakers sounded way better. After further inspection I noticed the bottom facing speakers were caked in what looked like dried earwax! Or vomit or something… 20 minutes later with some isopropyl and a dental pick took care of it though. But it was nasty. Other than that speaker nonsense, everything else was in perfect condition, which shocked me because I didn’t even opt for the “excellent condition” option. I think I chose the middle option so I was expecting at least some scratches but the phone was literally immaculate except for the nasty bottom facing speakers. I’m assuming this is due to a lack of quality control at the third party refurb center. If I didn’t already get rid of my other phone I probably would’ve sent this one back to get replaced.","R3A1UA5I93KHH1",,,,,,,,,,,"23","Everything was perfect!

I’m happy with it and I’m enjoying the size… a little hefty and the case I have used since my iPhone 11 was redesigned. It puts the camera protector in the way of making good contact with a Magtech charger. Now my only issue is it has 3 scratches on the screen. They are hard to feel with a fingernail, two are only about 1/8 of an inch and down toward the bottom of the screen. The biggest one is less than a 1/2 of an inch but it too is hairline and only noticeable in certain angles. For $825 dollars and what is supposed to be in excellent condition I’m a bit disappointed in having those on the screen…. I might contact the seller to see what they can do for me.

I was a little skeptical but took a chance anyway. When it arrived the packaging wasn't great. I feel foe the amount I spent it should have been packaged better. There was no bubble wrap to protect the phone or screen. It didn't come with a real apple charger or plug just a off brand plug no cord. The phone did not have any visible marks other than a little nick on the back near the camera lenses. Also, the phone was very easy to setup with assistance of our network carrier. She was very happy when she received it. It was a major upgrade from her iPhone 8 plus. Other than the packaging or lack thereof I was pleased with this purchase.

Otherwise pretty good buy so far. And note, even though stated in the description of the product, they no longer sell with the charging adapter.

The ability to customize something as basic as the keyboard (to the effective degree you can in android) is frustratingly absent, and you are stuck with the most basic of keyboards that require you to have to flip through different keyboard screens just to get to common things like a questionmark. Phone specific, the cameras and what not are good, but the screen colors are a tad washed out/pale, and there really isn't a fix for it. All and all, my next phone won't be an iphone, apple IOS is just too archaic and undeveloped compared to android, but the phone is decent enough that I'll hang on to it for a year or so before upgrading, which is something I don't usually do, given my last phone was a Note 9 that I used for 4 years.

However I can’t lie when I say there’s so many features that I miss on androids. Of course there’s unique features with this IPhone I very much appreciate. The battery life is great so far and I love that I can see the battery percentage of my Bluetooth ear buds. However, I’m VERY disappointed with the charger this phone comes with. 1 week of use and the charger was already refusing to charge my phone.

There are some annoying scratches on the screen if you are one who does not like this and always keep a screen protected from the time the phone is new. They are still visible all of the time.

The problem is that Mr hatefulness got it for me for my birthday and he got it on a payment plan under his name cut the bill then wanted me to pay for my birthday gift he chose to make payments on. I refuse to pay for a gift so I got myself a cheap phone for the time. Now I got this phone. It’s supposed to be excellent quality… But the speaker on this phone is nowhere near as good as my other iPhone 13 Pro Max with 1tb that Mr hatefulness got me but refuses to pay for. I use that phone on WiFi and listen to my music on that phone at home but when I get away from the signal I’m stuck with a crappy speaker phone. 🫨 I guess I expected excellent quality instead of just good quality speaker since I paid for excellent quality phone. Crazy that my old phones speaker works so much better. All in all it’s a great phone I’m just really into music which is why I got the phone with the 1tb memory. So I can save my music to my phone. That and cuz I have like 7 TikTok’s. They keep shutting me down.

He’s also had issues with sound quality with the phone, but it’s on the caller end. The microphone doesn’t appear to work well and I originally thought it was just my phone that was making him sound muffled but everyone he spoke to apparently also had this issue where they couldn’t hear him or understand him.

Especially for a 500gb model. BUT the listing also claimed it was in excellent condition. And tbh after a few days I can’t agree. There’s two small chips in the front screen, three small chips around the edge of the back glass, scratches and scrapes around the entire edge of the frame, and possibly most importantly is the battery is only at 84 capacity.

Yo creo que comprar el linea lleva sus riesgos de que te lleguen las cosas mal, tal vez sea mejor comprar en la tienda apple.
