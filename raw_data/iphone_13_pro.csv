The product was shipped and arrived quickly which was nice to see however it was shipped loosely inside of an oversized and flimsy android box with a big android logo on it. This was initially worrysome as I did not order an android phone however upon further inspection I did recieve the phone I ordered. The phone in the box does not appear to be damaged however I will not be able to test functionality until christmas comes around. My main complaint as of now is the packaging. The product I ordered is an expensive product and was shipped loose in an oversized box only to be protected by a ziploc bag it was also inside of. The big green android stamp on the flimsy box as well as the warehouse sticker on the back of the phone make a wonderful and expensive gift look haphazard and give off a ""cheap ebay warehouse"" vibe. After I purchase an empty iphone box, clean, and repackage the item and then test functionality on christmas. I will update my review. TlDR: First impressions matter a lot. Shipping an expensive premium item loose in a flimsy mislabeled box, tarnishes the excitement which is expected from opening such an item.","R3AYZOAMA7RTCF","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71dxjYih4LL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71k4KmN0XAL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71saf26dVzL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71w0NZN2HdL._SY88.jpg",,,,"14","Packaging is terrible.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3AYZOAMA7RTCF","Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2024","7058","223",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Sierra Blue, Size: 1TB","B09LP77GDL","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Sierra Blue","Size","1TB"

The first phone came and had 100% battery which I was happy about, but there was a crack in the lower left corner. Disappointing, but I returned it and bought another from Amazon Renewed. The second phone had 85% battery health, which is still good, and it works perfectly. The reason I’m giving it 3 stars is the way they dragged their feet giving me my refund. I returned it, it showed it arrived at their facility on January 12, and they kept pushing out my refund date which was aggravating because now I had two phones on my credit card bill. I contacted them on Jan 28 and they told me not to worry, I’d have my refund by February 17. I said absolutely not, they had better refund me by the end of the month, or I was going to dispute the charge. The guy chatting with me reassured me I’d get my money by February 17 and I went in circles with him on this, with us both stating the same thing over again. I ended it by telling him to tell his supervisor (who he had contacted to find out about the refund), that if I wasn’t refunded by Jan 31, I would be disputing it. I had the refund by the next day. So that was a pain and started to make me feel like it was a scam. It all turned out well, but they did not make the process easy. Supposedly they have to have received it AND processed the return for me to be refunded, but it was a ridiculous amount of time and should have been done long before. That being said, I’m happily typing this review from the second phone I bought from them and it’s in great condition.","R3561BVEJS6HOV",,,,,,,,"102","End product was good, but a hassle","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3561BVEJS6HOV","Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2024","7058","223",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Graphite, Size: 1TB","B09LP77GDL","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Graphite","Size","1TB"

It’s refurbished and everything described as true to form memory color model. The device works as expected for a refurbished phone battery. Life is probably not 100% but it’s pretty good. I would give it 3.5 stars but you can’t do halves on Amazon. I give it that because the screen is an aftermarket replace screen. It’s raised up higher than a regular iPhone screen, which would be fine but the screen sensitivity is very low. It almost doesn’t respond to your fingers in a lot of cases and a few place, a screen protector on there that makes it a lot worse. This affects you when trying to scroll through social media play games or even type out text sometimes you’ll hit the letter multiple times and it will not respond and put the letter in not a major deal. Just mildly inconvenient and extremely aggravating, but it is again a refurbished device.","R1250BYZVVHGSJ",,,,,,,,"2","Real Unlocked IPhone/ Poor aftermarket screen that is not responsive","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1250BYZVVHGSJ","Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2025","7058","223",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Sierra Blue, Size: 256GB","B09LP77GDL","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Sierra Blue","Size","256GB"

At 82% and the amount of phone time I have in the day, 82% wasn’t cutting it. So then I ordered this phone mostly for a better battery and better pictures. Well it takes better pictures and has a better screen (which I don’t really care about ). When I checked the battery percentage, it was the exact same as my iPhone 11, at 82%. It’s should last longer than my iPhone 11 at the same percentage, but it doesn’t seem to be. I still need to charge it by evening time. I don’t know whether to return the phone and try to get a better percentage battery or just to splurge another hundred dollars and get somebody to replace it for me. Right now , the place that I go to does not have one in stock. It took an hour for my eSIM to be transferred onto the new phone (couldn’t use the physical card) as well.

No other problems, so I returned it, and bought a new one. Despite doing everything I could to preserve battery life, it drained at least 10% an hour without anything in the background occurring. I even spoke to an Apple representative and they said the battery was behaving extremely abnormal, even my old phone had a better battery capacity. Besides that, the phone functioned wonderfully and even came with a screen protector! It's a shame that I had all these problems as I really wanted a new iPhone 13 Pro so I could get more storage and keep all the features I like about my current phone.

Upon unboxing, I discovered the speakers were clogged and dirty, severely impacting sound quality right from the start. Even more disheartening was the back of the phone, which was marred by irremovable spots that no amount of cleaning could fix. To add to the frustration, the charging port was filled with dust, complicating the charging process significantly.

There is a couple of very tiny scratches, almost imperceivable on the outside corner of the screen and one on one of the lenses (of no consequence). There is also a small ding just above the Lightning port at the bottom of the phone, also has no effect on performance. After more than 2 weeks of use, the phone has performed as I would expect and hope. The Excellent designation comes with a guarantee that the battery will have a greater than 80% health rating. Well, for this phone, it just clears that rating at 81% health. I was hoping for a higher rating, but it still qualifies by their rule and so far charging times have been normal. One more real disappointing issue for me, is that the screen, although mostly in excellent condition over its surface, the edges of it looked unusually rough, kind of wavy or uneven. This wouldn’t be so bad in use, however after installing a screen protector, this edge unevenness resulted in air pockets being created underneath the glass protector. A possible vulnerability to collecting dust and dirt. So far it has been a worthwhile purchase and I hope this phone will continue to provide excellent service. Time will tell and this will be the first place I’ll come to report any changes.","R2L4TPWQZ6S51C",,,,,,,,"12","Got What I Ordered…","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2L4TPWQZ6S51C","Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2025","7058","389",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Graphite, Size: 256GB","B09LP77GDL","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Graphite","Size","256GB"

The exterior was clean, and the sides were spotless, except for a bit of dirt on the silencer and in the speakers, but nothing too concerning. The screen did have some minor scratches that were noticeable without a screen protector, but once the protector was on, they were hardly visible. The phone has the right amount of storage, exactly what I needed. The battery health is at 83%, which isn’t perfect but still acceptable for my usage. I was a bit disappointed when I realized my box didn’t come with a SIM card pin, especially after seeing other reviews mention it. All I received was the phone and a charger. Unfortunately, the charger was subpar, it has a shortage and is not a lightning charger. Thankfully, I had an extra charger on hand, so this issue wasn’t a dealbreaker for me. One small issue I’ve noticed is that the microphone seems to be a bit low when recording voice messages, so I find myself needing to speak louder than usual. However, the overall quality of the phone is good, and I haven’t encountered any major problems yet. I feel like this phone was a good value for the money. Despite the minor dirt and the low microphone volume, it came in excellent condition. Setting up the phone was easy, especially since I was moving from Android to iPhone. The Face ID works perfectly, and the regular passcode option adds extra security. I was initially worried about the camera quality since the phone is renewed, but I was pleasantly surprised, the camera quality is amazing. So far, so good!","R15K78VMXF92QE","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719i88H4ppL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71GJgQdMfPL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Ovo3zOCIL._SY88.jpg",,,,,"29","Excellent product","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15K78VMXF92QE","Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2024","7058","389",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Sierra Blue, Size: 512GB","B09LP77GDL","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Sierra Blue","Size","512GB"

The screen is not flush with the seam, have no reference to go on if it's a defect. Like having a real sim card slot, 13 is the last Apple before full eSim. Still has lighting port but found some usb c to lighting adapters. Setup was easy switching, found most the apps are the same on any platform, just more expensive on Apple. Battery is at 86, Apple recommends replacement at 85 I believe. Sometimes the screen frame-rate drops so low it can see the refresh lines. Again no reference on if normal for Apple. About the OS, Android you can just put any music in the ringtone folder. Apple you have to buy some Zedge like ringers from iTunes or make and convert 30s audio file. Camera is not impressive, Ultra looks better and an older model. Typing is more controlled but find I have to delete everything and retype more then gboard. Like the size and weight of regular pro model better then alot of other devices. Safari is pretty good, had almost no issues, do not miss chrome. Notifications seem slow and randomly batched but Andriods a mess too. Most smart devices had no issues but Fitbit works but only in forground not really a problem. No other Android watch will work. Audio is good, thought the notch would bother me more, its definitely a camera notch. I do miss touch id, the in screen or face id is just not on the sane level. So grabbing text from an image is pretty cool and easy. Cut and pasting images easy. Getting a download file to the right folder to use in another app is a pain.

My cell carrier local store helped me resolve this problem in short order. This refurbished phone seems to be a good option when a phone needs an upgrade. I didn’t want to take on the high cost of a new phone. THERE MAY BE A NO RETURN POLICY and you may need to pay for shipping. These are the things you may want to be sure to read as you look at the phones. This phone was received well packaged, clean and ready to use, except for the SIM card thing I mentioned.

I show a minor scuff along the edge, and on the screen I was unable to photograph it because it was so hard to show, but in the light at an angle you can see a tiny scratch on the screen that is so thin it looks like lint.

The box came with a charging brick (not original) and a charging cord which looks like an original but i’m not sure, either way they didn’t feel cheap, the box came with no sim ejector tool which was unfortunate.

After I read the reviews I decided to take a chance. I order the Silver IPhone 13 Pro in “excellent” condition 128GB. When I received the phone it came in a box with a SIM card tool, a fast charging cord, and the phone. ( there was NO block for the cord) Upon expecting the phone it was a bit dirty around the cameras however there was not dents/ scratches. For the battery life I’ve received 87% I wasn’t expecting it to be 100%,however I’ve seen others get a higher percentage. Other than that the battery being lower than expected and the camera area being dirty, the phone quality is lovely. It’s a big upgrade from my old phone. It’s definitely more of a budget friendly choice.","R30AOAOQX91GPG","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Khu+6dobL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71IbBornYaL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71l2yUh1NhL._SY88.jpg",,,,,"9","Sliver 13 pro 128gb ( “excellent” condition)","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30AOAOQX91GPG","Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2024","7058","389",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Silver, Size: 128GB","B09LP77GDL","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Silver","Size","128GB"

I think it depends on the seller/the randomness of the phones they fix up when you get a 'bad' one. I went through DirectCertified I believe, for a blue 128 GB iPhone 13 pro. I ordered on a Saturday, it was shipped out on Sunday, and I received it on Tuesday morning - I did have to sign for it. It came in a white box, sealed, and when you opened the box there was a 30-day warranty instruction/troubleshooting instruction. There was also a SIM card poker, a new charger underneath the phone, and the phone wrapped in bubble wrap. It also had a protective film around the phone. When I inspected it, the phone was honestly in near-perfect physical condition, just had some dirt around the camera lenses. I wiped it away quickly. The battery life was ay 87%, which is decent for a used phone, and given the price I paid, I'm happy with what I received. I will keep testing everything of course for the next month, but so far so good on quality and service!","R1JFD60Y19TK9D",,,,,,,,"3","So far so good - phone came better than expected.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1JFD60Y19TK9D","Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2024","7058","389",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Sierra Blue, Size: 128GB","B09LP77GDL","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Sierra Blue","Size","128GB"

Its running smoothly, its perfect. However, I have a couple issues with it. I didn't like the charger they gave me. I wasn't expecting an on-brand Apple charger, but the charger it came with, charges very slow. I also wasn't impressed with the packaging. The phone was wrapped in bubble wrap, and placed in a cardboard box with the chargers and the cube rattling around in the box. Then that box was packaged in the classic Amazon plastic bag. I wish there was more cushioning for the phone. And lastly, I noticed the phone's screen is more pink than my previous phone. The picture on the left is my iPhone 13 screen, taken on the iPhone 13 Pro I bought, and the picture on the right is the 13 Pro screen, taken on my iPhone 13 camera.

Not a scratch on it anywhere. Charging port and speakers are free of pocket lint, cameras don’t have one scratch on them. The only reason I have it a 4 star is the battery life is at 85%. Was hoping for a little more for it being in “excellent” condition but not mad about it! Packaged very well, next day shipping was spot on and it came with a new cable and charger block. 9/10 would recommend if you need a quick phone buy.","RS279JBOKDXLF",,,,,,,,,"Not too bad!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RS279JBOKDXLF","Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2024","7058","389",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Alpine Green, Size: 256GB","B09LP77GDL","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Alpine Green","Size","256GB"

You have to pay for majority of apps that will allow you access to things and you must have a wireless airpod to listen to audio( which by the way is terrible for your health). It made me realize how clever Apple’s IT and Marketing team is, because they spend all their time making cool accessories and apps for ppl to purchase to add on to a standard phone that also costs a fortune. Make ppl pay monthly fees for everything. They’re really banking from every angle! But the next time I get another phone, I’m going back to Android!

Note that shipping was very slow, and even after I contacted customer support and opened a case, there was no explanation as to why the product was takingk so long. Amazon had me confirm that I still wanted it about 5 days before shipping just because it was so delayed. Once the product arrived, it was packed in a brown box. The phone is in good shape, as it should since it was marked as ""Excellent"". However, the battery life was disappointing at just 85%. My own personal iPhone 13 Pro which is 2 years and 3 months old is at 89% and so I expected more from this given that it was supposed to be Excellent. Lastly, the charger that came with it is very low quality, it's a 5W charger that takes forever to charge the phone. I expected a 20W or 30W modern charger, those are not costly nowadays, the seller could have been a bit more generous. In summary, the phone is alright, but the delay in shipping and the lack or transparency is what makes this a questionable deal. The interesting thing is that despite what looked like an obvious problem with supply, which I can understand, Amazon kept selling the devices as if everything was Ok, the page kept taking orders and pretending they could get the device to you in 2 days, which was an absolute joke. In my case, it was a present and made me look bad because it took so long to show up.

Batteries have been replaced with new ones and are 100% healthy. And this one costs just $479. what is the difference? First of all, it doesn't have the original packaging. It only has repackaging from Amazon. It only has a mobile phone, a charger and a charging cable, but none of them are original Apple accessories. Secondly, I think Amazon's product testing standards are a bit low, because the phone I bought had a lot of scratches and damage, and I wrapped it with a red circle, which proved that the original owner didn't like wearing phone cases and cases. The most important thing is that the battery health is too low, only 87%. It should be replaced in less than a year or two. I own an iPhone 13 pro max. As of now, the health value is still 94%. The above is for reference only, maybe the one you bought may be better than mine. I'm just saying that Amazon sets the bar a little low for refurbished units.The best thing is that it provides a 90-day return period, which Amazon likes.","R14EQH16UEH6HA","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6108ucjEGXL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61NLAVXqEbL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71IiNFP79yL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Jm2-EJxFL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71OvmNiYltL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71uPHWcpgPL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81OvQxMjSML._SY88.jpg",,"Testing standards are a bit low","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14EQH16UEH6HA","Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2024","7058","203",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Graphite, Size: 128GB","B09LP77GDL","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Graphite","Size","128GB"

However, even though I take great effort to use the battery efficiently, over the past few months I have been battling with extreme battery draining. It can not even make it from 9 to 3 pm when only being used for time without the battery being on life support. While off, I also have been having issue with it draining. For instance, last night I had it charged to 80%, turned it off at 12:30 am then at 7 am woke up, turned it on, and found it at 2%. I have gone to apple for help and they have been extremely unhelpful about my issue since they found no problems and my battery health is ""good."" This phone is more trouble than it is worth. I wanted to do some good by decreasing phone waste, but this was not it. Never buying from here or apple again. There are so many better phones out there.

I would not call this a small issue, especially because it is VERY noticeable and it’s not just an app or two, the entire screen is a mess. Very disheartening, I was really nervous to buy and pleasantly surprised when it was lovely, but I guess it was too good to be true. :( Also shipping was hell and it send me to two different cities almost 2 hrs apart to pick it up so there’s that. But that’s not really on the seller it’s on the shipping company - but it did make this an absolutely awful experience.

And it has been doing something where it shuts off and blinks the apple logo on and off. A couple months later, the camera does not work and I got a notification saying it is not an original accessory.

Within the first day of having the phone, steam is visible around the edges of the screen and the edge has chipped, despite having been treated with incredible care. It hadn’t been dropped or around water. The quality of the screen is subpar in comparison to every other iPhone I’ve had in the last 15 years. The screen itself has a dark tint to it, making it near impossible to read text while I’m wearing my sunglasses, which has NEVER been an issue in the past. Additionally, it has a bazar reflective affect that, again, makes the phone very difficult to use in certain lights and outside, even in the shade.

Since day one, the GPS hasn’t worked properly—when I open Google Maps or Waze, it constantly loses signal. This makes the phone almost useless for driving or using any navigation app. Even worse, I found out that all of the phone’s components had been replaced—the screen, battery, camera, and housing. None of this was disclosed in the product description. What I received was essentially a fully rebuilt device, not a used one in ""like new"" condition. I tried to request a refund, but the seller refused to help unless I returned the product first. At the time, returning it was completely out of the question for personal/logistical reasons, and I felt abandoned with no real support. I thought I was saving money by buying a high-quality used phone, but I ended up with a defective device, no proper assistance, and now I have to buy another one. I’m genuinely afraid of going through the same thing again, especially with a seller who wasn’t honest or helpful. Very bad experience.

I was very excited to get the product as it's directly from Amazon with a guaranteed good quality and functioning phone. Upon opening I transferred all of the data from my old phone and my e sim, to find out that the camera was broken and the battery health was poor. The camera had these weird black blotches on the pictures, something that I've had on my previous iPhone when the entire lenses were broken, as well as a pop that read ""Not a genuine iPhone camera"", meaning that it was either a replace part, broken part, incorrectly installed, or not genuine apple product. On top of that the phone was very hot and the battery health was sitting at 82%, which is below average for an ""excellent"" quality phone. I knew this was a risk going into buying a refurbished phone, but since this is directly through Amazon I thought there would some class, reputation, and good quality control on their products. Although there is a 90 day guarantee, you can only do UPS pickup, in which a ups driver will come at a random time during the next 3 consecutive business days to pick up the package. You cannot drop off the package. How am I supposed to plan my day around a UPS driver coming at any time during the day when I have school, a job, and other things to do? I cannot just sit around my house the entire day waiting for this driver... Overall a terrible experience and I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, especially considering how bad the customer service has been with Amazon and UPS. Considering the reputation of both of these companies I decided to take a chance, but it did not pay off. Do not be fooled by the rest of these good reviews that have good quality phones unless you are a gambler.","R31IJI48CSK3DA","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Ii32W++5L._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,"23","Camera came damaged, low battery health, overall very disappointed","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31IJI48CSK3DA","Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2024","7058","538",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Silver, Size: 128GB","B09LP77GDL","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Silver","Size","128GB"

I bought 2 refurbished iPhone 13 Pros That were described to be in “excellent condition”. Neither device had any noticeable flaws, but I experienced several issues as time went on. The charging cable that was provided not only could not hold a charge, but it overheated and partially melted when it was plugged into my portable battery, a battery that I’ve used successfully with several other cables. This was concerning, as the cable is one of the easiest things to get right. It makes me wonder what other corners the company cut during the refurbishing process. Secondly, I received a notification that stated that the phone was unable to determine if the camera was a genuine Apple part. It took pictures just fine, but I was not expecting to see this pop up. The second device worked fine for a number of hours, but the phone could not sustain a wi-fi connection. The wi-fi settings indicated that I was connected to my wi-fi (wherein I was logged into my network), but there was no connection icon on the top right of the screen, nor was I able to use the connection at all. Every other device in my home remains connected to the internet, it’s just the new phone that won’t. I made numerous attempts to troubleshoot the problem myself, including updating to the latest OS, resetting the network settings, hard resetting the phone, enabling/disabling airplane mode, turning off the private wi-fi address, forgetting the network, disabling the VPN, and configuring the DNS. None of these solutions worked, and the phone continues to not connect to the wi-fi. Blue Chip’s customer service is never available. Overall, this was an extremely frustrating experience and I wasted over $1,000. I will not be purchasing again.","R3VK4SGDTNBOQW","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61NQgO+BG3L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61eZVAgVL3L._SY88.jpg",,,,,,"23","Disappointing","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3VK4SGDTNBOQW","Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2024","7058","538",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Silver, Size: 128GB","B09LP77GDL","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Silver","Size","128GB"

We did and paid $15 shipping to have it sent back. Days later, we received a refund of 1 cent for a $500 phone. I called customer service, who informed me that they had messaged me to inform me that, until they get my login Apple info, they wouldn't refund me. Then, they claimed I needed to log out on my Apple account. I did. Then, they claimed they didn't receive the information for that and are making me wait. Customer service claims, if it's a third-party seller, they need to issue a refund regardless. If the item is sent back within the return window, it is obvious the item is defective and the money needs to be refunded. Do not buy from them. They've done this to so many people, not just me. And it's a different excuse every time.","R3USH797769316",,,,,,,,"19","No Refund for a Broken Phone","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3USH797769316","Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2025","7058","538",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Graphite, Size: 256GB","B09LP77GDL","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Graphite","Size","256GB"

It arrived, but FaceID was not working. Apple said it was irreparable without basically a whole new phone. The camera system is inseparably connected to the security hardware. So I started a return and ordered another one. Next day, next iPhone. Alas, it too is not as described. It reports “Unknown camera hardware.” That may result in software failure or sub-standard performance. Called support, can’t be fixed. I should not have to buy three phones just to get one that works when Amazon in their listing represents it as tested, fully functional, and up to Amazon standards. That is false advertising. I could get a lawyer. I’ve spent hours now troubleshooting two phones. What are the odds this would happen two days apart? That tells me your odds will be high for getting a garbage phone. Wasted time. Frustration. The whole point of refurbished is to save a little money. That value proposition is quickly erased when you have to troubleshoot, return, troubleshoot, return, over and over. Forget it. I will only buy refurbished iPhones from Apple. Buyer beware on Amazon. They did take both phones back but what a fiasco. Update: I would remove a star and leave zero or negative stars. In the attached photo you can see the effect of the off-brand camera parts: no zoom modes (I have 3 13 pros so I know what it should be). As a result they sold a Pro that isn’t really a pro.

Initially, the raised display didn't bother me too much, even though I noticed the lack of True Tone. I figured it wasn't a big deal and planned to have it checked out by a local Apple technician here in Jamaica. However, yesterday, when I tried to take a picture, I discovered that my back camera wouldn't zoom to 0.5x or 3x and few of the camera features like the cinematic and up-close camera doesn't work anymore . That's when I realized there was a more serious problem with the phone. I understand repairs are complex and you're running a business, but I bought this phone while traveling and am now back home where returning it is impossible. The shipping cost, time without my phone (which I use heavily for work), and the customs, duty, GCT, and shipping fees to get it back into the country make it impractical, even if you fixed or replaced it. I bought it abroad to avoid these issues. I'm asking for your consideration and help with a refund, partial refund, or some compensation. I wouldn't bother you if only the screen was an issue - I was already planning to have that fixed at an Apple store. But fixing both the screen and camera is too expensive.

I’ve bought refurbished before, but this time I experienced great dissatisfaction in the phone AND Amazon! This phone Would not set up Face ID and would not pair with my Apple Watch. I spent 6 days trying to get this phone to work as it was told to me. I even searched the Apple forums for help and there was only one way to setup Face ID. Of course, Amazon is not going to send me a replacement)this phone was almost $850) they would only offer a refund. I didn’t have a backup phone (iPhone XS) had just died and there was no way I could get it up and running, so I had to fork out another $875 for another refurbished iPhone 13 Pro so I would have at least one working phone. The new one finally arrived 4 days later (no 2 day shipping offered) and after I made sure Face ID worked and everything else paired or synced as it should, off to the ups store to send defective phone back. Amazon you let me down, did not test everything on the first phone, or you would have caught these problems. My advice for shoppers looking for a refurbished phone, be careful, use caution and don’t expect Amazon to care one way or another. They just want your money!","R31XQ6C5YHMBJA",,,,,,,,"13","Be very careful when purchasing a refurbished phone","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31XQ6C5YHMBJA","Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2023","7058","538",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Graphite, Size: 512GB","B09LP77GDL","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Graphite","Size","512GB"

The real problems came from trying to set up the phone. Not only was the FaceID unavailable even after multiple restarts, resets, updates, and a clean set up. The back and front camera were not working properly the whole time. The flash refused to work, there may have been issues with the True depth sensor because those features were unable to work on every application. For spending 600+ dollars I expected MUCH better quality. Customer support was trashy too not offer a replacement for THEIR damaged phone they sent me. Was only offered a refund for sending the phone back, and a partial refund if I kept the phone. The partial refund was also, 50$ out of a 600$ purchase. Again just to tell you all the partial refund would be 50$. Probably not even enough to pay for someone to repair the issues with the phone. Extremely frustrating and disrespectful. Just to point out the battery life was at 85% for an in ""excellent condition"" refurbished phone. I highly doubt when this phone gets sent back it won't get fixed properly for the next poor soul to get.","R2BYVRHXPAGXGV",,,,,,,,"48","Phone came damaged and was not offered a replacement.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2BYVRHXPAGXGV","Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2023","7058","538",,,"Service Provider: Verizon, Color: Sierra Blue, Size: 128GB","B09LP77GDL","Service Provider","Verizon","Color","Sierra Blue","Size","128GB"

Also, I checked the battery Health and it’s at 75%! I have an iPhone XR from 2017 and it’s battery health is still at 88%. So they clearly swapped multiple parts and replaced them with junk 3rd party ones. It is so very unfortunate. I dono how these people sleep at night.

Thinking it was me, i went to the Genius store and the wonderful technician worked on it for over 2 hours. Still no service. I went to a dealer he ended up putting in a new sim. And since ATT could not confirm i owned my old phone and verified Call records, required my phone to be offline for 12 hours. What an inconveniencesince.

However, when I sent our traded-in phone (we thought we had done everything, we wiped it), it was connected to the iCloud, a step we missed. The company sent me an Amazon email stating that it was rejected. I called Amazon, and it was at this point that Amazon said, oh, this is a different seller. So I tried to reach out to them, but the Amazon link had a page error. I tried sending them a message and got nothing back. Instead of allowing us to disconnect the phone from iCloud (which we could do simply without needing the phone), they just returned it. I've tried to reach out to them but heard nothing back.

How is it possible that a premium product like this could have such a severe issue after only a year? It’s absolutely mind-boggling and, frankly, infuriating. We invested a significant amount of money into this phone, expecting reliability and quality, but here we are, dealing with a destroyed device and no real solutions being offered.

Literally had to speed through the setup to get to the Home Screen and try to fix it. I tried everything I can get it to work, but nothing is fixing it. Spent hours and hours for nothing. My last resort is sending it to Apple for repairs and PAY MORE out of my pocket, that's just awful. I already paid for this phone; I expected it to work out of the box with no issues. Sadly, I had to return it (with UPS packaging fees) and hopefully get my money back soon. They should've tested it before sending it out to me, wasted my time and money.
