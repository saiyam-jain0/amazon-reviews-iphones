Very very minimal scratches and very little signs of wear and tear. I think it’s possible the screen has been replaced because the screen is not as sensitive as I would expect and sometimes I have to click on stuff more than once. No issues with the side buttons or either camera. My only real “gripe” with this phone is the battery health, which is at 78%. I would have thought excellent condition would have gotten me somewhere in the 80% range. That being said, it’s a back up phone so I don’t have it in constant use. For someone who was using it as their main phone, the battery drain would be a major issue. It does charge pretty fast and no issues with the charging port. The box came with the charging cord and the little pin device to get the SIM card tray out. It was unlocked and easy to link to my T-Mobile account. Overall I’m pleased with the product.","R3ON2HEUVETUH","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7121LiivsfL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71IHE2-FUpL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71T1KwFSFrL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71WfDWz8uvL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ql16hl1gL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81w6HyqfovL._SY88.jpg",,"6","Great deal for the price","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3ON2HEUVETUH","Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2025","16635","638",,,"Size: 64GB, Color: Black, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PPDJWC8","Size","64GB","Color","Black","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

The camera has been consistently good, capturing clear and vibrant photos and videos, which I really appreciate. From the moment I got it, there were no visible defects. It felt and looked premium. I also absolutely loved the size of this phone; it's so comfortable to hold and use with one hand, fitting easily into any pocket. Plus, it came with plenty of storage, so I've never had to worry about running out of space for my apps and photos. My main frustration, however, is that the battery seems to run out very quickly, especially since I first got it. It struggles to last a full day with moderate use, and I often find myself needing to charge it much sooner than I'd like. This has become a noticeable issue over time. Despite the battery life, the compact design, excellent camera, and ample storage still make it a solid choice. It's a fantastic phone if you prioritize a smaller form factor, but be prepared to keep a charger handy. Works exactly as I needed it to. It is unlocked so I was able to take it to Google fi and have no problems with compatibility.","R2UPK3FHU1MCGJ",,,,,,,,,"Great Little Phone with a Fantastic Camera, But Battery Life Drains a Little Too Fast","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2UPK3FHU1MCGJ","Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2025","16635","638",,,"Size: 256GB, Color: Green, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PPDJWC8","Size","256GB","Color","Green","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

The iPhone arrived in like-new condition—no scratches, no performance issues, and everything worked perfectly right out of the box. The screen is bright and clear, the phone feels solid and durable, and it charges quickly. I also appreciated that it came fully unlocked, which made setup with my carrier easy and hassle-free. Another nice bonus: I had multiple color options to choose from, which isn’t always the case with refurbished phones. The only downside I’ve noticed is that the battery doesn’t hold a charge as long as a brand-new phone, but it’s still more than usable for a full day with moderate use. If needed, a battery replacement down the road would still make this a great deal overall. If you’re looking for a quality replacement iPhone at a great price, this is probably the best option I’ve come across. Definitely recommended!","RUXIXOZAF9ZDT",,,,,,,,"5","Great Value iPhone – Like New and Reliable","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUXIXOZAF9ZDT","Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2025","16635","638",,,"Size: 64GB, Color: Blue, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PPDJWC8","Size","64GB","Color","Blue","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

The phone arrived in excellent condition—clean, fully functional, and looked almost brand new. The white color gives it a modern, minimalist feel that I really love. The size is one of the biggest selling points for me. It's lightweight and fits comfortably in my pocket, yet it delivers the same powerful performance as larger iPhones. The screen is sharp and bright, and everything from scrolling to switching between apps is smooth and fast, thanks to the A14 Bionic chip. Even though it’s a smaller phone, the camera quality is excellent. Photos come out crisp and clear, and it handles low light better than I expected. Battery life is solid too—I get a full day on a single charge with regular use. The fact that it’s unlocked gave me the freedom to use it with my current carrier without any hassle. Being a renewed product, it also came at a significantly lower price than new, but with the same Apple quality. If you're looking for a compact, high-performance iPhone without paying full price, this is a fantastic choice. I’m very happy with this purchase and highly recommend it!","R5AS8GE8UROTL",,,,,,,,"6","love it","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5AS8GE8UROTL","Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2025","16635","638",,,"Size: 64GB, Color: White, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PPDJWC8","Size","64GB","Color","White","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

Yes, it is a few generations down from the newest, and yes these are specifically refurbished as well. Even so! My phone arrived in basically new condition a year ago, and has worked well since. Battery life is...not amazing, but Iphones honestly don't have great battery life. They'll last you through the day depending on your use, but not much past that. That's fine, I charge mine often. 64GB's is plenty for a phone unless you are recording often and keeping a large gallery or a ton of apps. I like the smaller size of the phone, I think phones are getting too big, and this has all the features of a big phone in the smaller package. I like the facial recognition (although it feels dystopian) as it makes unlocking the phone a breeze. I think the camera is very passable, and I like the screen. If not for being worried about dropping it, the outer case is beautiful. Apple outdid themselves. What I don't like. The size...is actually still a bit too big for me. The Iphone SE (1st Generation) used the Iphone 5 frame. I thought that frame was truly amazing, as it wasn't very big at all. Easy to one hand, almost as if designed to be. It in fact *WAS* designed to be. When I first got it, I realized this. It is too big to one hand comfortably, it's not quite so big that 2 hands feels truly right. It's fine, but I feel the mini should have been actually a touch smaller. Also, I honestly kinda dislike having almost all the phone's front be the screen. There's nowhere good to rest your hand to support it without touching the screen. I used to wrap my hand around the phone and support it with my thumb across the front, near where the button was. It's a nitpick, but I just don't dig it as much. For $200~275 though, is it worth it? Ab-so-lutely. It's a great phone, I bought mine I think for near double that, and I only somewhat regretted the price tag. It's held up very nice the past year, and I don't expect to have to replace it for a good number. If not for the busted screen on my old phone, I'd still be rocking it despite a truly not good battery. This one makes for a fine replacement, and if you want a new Iphone, this is the one to get.","R3J0SBIXDEHQFX",,,,,,,,"51","A great phone, though no replacement for my Iphone SE (1st Generation)","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3J0SBIXDEHQFX","Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2024","16635","638",,,"Size: 64GB, Color: Black, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PPDJWC8","Size","64GB","Color","Black","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

Always missed my 4S that you could stick in a shirt pocket. If I want to screen big enough to read a book I'll grab an iPad. This is small and light enough to take everywhere and hardly notice it. Having said that it replaced an iPhone 8 and the screen actually measures slightly larger than the 8 does since it doesn't have a border at the top and bottom. Am pleased with the quality of the renewed device; it came with barely a scratch, maybe a little rubbing on one edge but not noticeable with the Otter case on it. No scratches or flaws on the face glass. The battery shows 85% capacity which I was disappointed about at first but seems to be better than what many other reviewers are reporting. The phone arrived 3 days earlier than the estimate which was nice. Came with a charge cable as advertised. Rated down a star not for any quality issue but because the price dropped by $10 during the time I ordered it and the day it arrived.","R276E2GNABSL6G",,,,,,,,"8","Nice, compact phone, renewed in very nice condition.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R276E2GNABSL6G","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2025","16635","638",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Blue, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PPDJWC8","Size","128GB","Color","Blue","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

Screen: The screen feels very smooth if you are upgrading from something less newer. Easy to play games on if you have small hands as well as type. I recommend a screen protector cause every iPhone to ever exist is easy to get scratches without you even noticing. Battery: My phone came with 87% battery health and I was fine with it until within just a week or so it went down to 85%. That’s my only real problem with this phone. Camera: The quality is amazing so if you take pictures this will satisfy most of your needs. It’s definitely more than worth it if you’re looking to upgrade to something better or newer. Appearance: I personally got the red color and it looks amazing and brand new. The phone comes in a box with a SIM card opener pin, charger without cube, paper with information about the phone and seller, and the phone is inside a little bag. **Although it might not be important but if you for example get the 128 GB and you have the latest IOS update that means you’ll have 10GB less due to the software.

I think the only problem I have with it is the battery - I mean, even the phone as new has a battery capacity of about 2200mAh - so this one with 86% battery life wasn’t expected to do much. A full charge lasts for about 6 hours if you only browse the internet (on WiFi), play music and watch videos. But once you are on a video call, a full charge will only last for about 1.5 hours.

When it arrived, I was worried that it would be damaged due to the way the product was packaged. It was placed inside a box loosely then put into an envelope that was lined with bubble wrap. However, upon inspection, the outer appearance was flawless! There was not a single scratch anywhere, not even the screen. Once I got the phone powered on and switched on with my carrier, I noticed the battery health was at 85%. This is lower than I was expecting, but it wasn’t a dealbreaker. I have used the phone vigorously and to my surprise, it has held up quite well. I do have to leave the Power Saver on for the battery life to last me throughout the day. I know this isn’t normal for an iPhone, but for being an old-ish model and since I am used to using a cheap android that has terrible battery life, I don’t mind having to charge it throughout the day.

Functionally perfect. However arrived with only 82% battery health. The advertisement guaranteed 80% or more so it did met its minimum as stated, but of course hoped for better (especially since this model isn't known for the longest battery life even when new). Would I do it again? = Probably. Should you do it? = not sure as every used iPhone is used and has a unique history of use and abuse and every refurbishment is done just enough to get unit up to minimum specifications so one used phone may not be fully indicative of what another is. If you get a dud you'd probably realize it soon and be able to erase and return. Since i was comfortable with the tech of knowing I was buying the right unit for my network, changing SIM cards and updating software, for me it seems like a better value than $1000 for a new phone.

I like that it handles 5G networks and runs on the latest operating system (17). This ""reconditioned"" or ""refurbished"" (EXCELLENT) phone truly looked brand-new. I've been using it for 3 days now, and it takes some getting used to, to navigate around the screens, finding your websites, tools, apps, etc. And CLOSING THEM is different, too. There's no more ""home"" button on the bottom center like my old phone. As for battery life, it seems to charge more quickly than my iPhone 7 did, but it still uses up the battery just as fast. Today I started with 100% power at 7 am and didn't make a single call, but did a few texts (with a couple of attached photos) and did browse a few websites. By 10 a.m. my battery was down to 80 percent.

I worked on transferring settings and such from her old phone to the new phone, and that took a lot longer (3 hours) instead of 15 min (like it should have) because the phone didn’t come reset to factory settings. I didn’t realize that at the beginning. I kept waiting for the Quick Start screen to pop up. Eventually, I realized that I needed to erase this brand new phone to get it back to factory settings. Once I did that, the Quick Start screen popped up and things worked as they were supposed to. (Actually, I had to erase it three times. The transfer didn’t work the first time because I guess I wasn’t properly connected to appleID on the old phone [that doesn’t complete make sense to me now but that was my conclusion at the time].

I recommend this phone, the only downside is its inherently smaller battery than the larger editions. It’s good for an entire day with moderate use. That’s not an issue really, my car, my monitor all have fast, wireless charging. I think of it like this. It’s a price/phone for a “ throw down “ phone.

I have to say, the 12 Mini is an upgrade in almost every possible way. The LED display makes my video games and pictures look so much better, and the A14 processor drops fewer frames. Not to mention reliable and fast 5G connection. My particular example, however, fell a little short of my hopes (though it did meet my expectations). The product descriptions for renewed products specify that the phone will arrive with a battery health of at least 80%, and no visible defects when held at arms' length. My phone has exactly 80% battery health, and a number of scuffs on the outer aluminum frame, which, as described, are not visible at arms' length. As a result, the battery life is actually slightly worse than my SE, and I decided not to get a clear case, so the scuffs wouldn't show at all. Nothing deal-breaking, but just a little reminder that the phone *is* used, so set your expectations and read the description. Other than the battery, I am highly satisfied with my purchase, and the price.","RYW5EYSTMV4VV",,,,,,,,"29","Item arrived as expected--barely","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYW5EYSTMV4VV","Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2023","16635","638",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: (Product)Red, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PPDJWC8","Size","128GB","Color","(Product)Red","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

However I know how important it was for me to see real reliable reviews so here it is… This review is going to be about the quality of product they sent me. Not the phone itself but I will cover that too. First impressions, Came very poorly packaged. I was really worried the phone was going to be broken or just horrible. The phone was only protected by a small box. The phone was loose in the box and it was only protected by a bit of bubble wrap. I took the phone out and immediately I wasn’t impressed. The phone was dirty like really dirty. I took about 5 minutes of wiping it down until I was satisfied. Then I noticed the scratches… there’s a huge scratch in the front near the camera and a couple more scratches in the back of the phone. This is a huge turn off for me because scratches really annoy me. Battery life was full capacity 100%. Phone itself ran beautifully. If your considering buying the 12 mini I’d highly recommend it! I wouldn't buy it renewed from Amazon if get it brand new. It’s worth spending the extra $100 for a new product. The size is great. If your coming from any iPhone 6,7,8 SE then the size of the phone is very comfortable. Battery life is amazing. I’m a intense user and the majority of reviews on the battery are false. I use Max brightness for about 7 hours on screen time and I still go to bed with around 20% battery.","R1YNH2X67U12T4","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B18+U-OtQzS._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1esFSmxtdS._SY88.jpg",,,,,,"118","Before you buy!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YNH2X67U12T4","Reviewed in the United States on September 22, 2021","16635","638",,,"Size: 64GB, Color: Black, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PPDJWC8","Size","64GB","Color","Black","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

However, when held at arms length scratches on screen are still very noticeable, but I don’t mind since they aren’t interfering with my ability to see anything. Seller has guaranteed on their page that when held at arms length that imperfections are not noticeable so this was not my experience. I also have the same issue that some other buyers have said they experienced in their comments that the seller sent the phone with a screen protector on. This covered up my and their phone’s imperfections well. But because I got a heads up on This tactic I removed the screen protector and found that my phone has larger scratches all over the screen.

The screen and cameras are intact. No third party replacements according to the about section in settings. Battery came with 82% which kinda sucks because it lasts for about 4hrs of screen-on-time on normal usage, and replacing it through apple costs about $70. All in all i'm satisfied with amazon refurbished and this seller, I got a good price for this phone ($350 for the 128gb version, vs $489 on apple.com/refurbished, though it does comes with a new battery and outer casing) About the phone itself: Its an amazing phone, there really isn't a noticeable difference between it and the newest iphones (excluding battery life), and its stupidly faster and better than my previous iphone 6s and LG G6.

But weird things have been happening. First, I couldn’t activate this phone with my career’s online tool— one where you log into your account and enter the phone’s IMEI. This has worked fine with all my previous phones. I had to call customer support for a specia activation process. Then, I noticed there were location services options missing on this device, specifically the Find My feature, and sharing my location in iMessages, which I use in my family group. When I say missing I mean certain buttons simply aren’t on my screen while they show up on another phone running the same iOS version. The last straw was when I logged into my account on Apple support and this phone shows an impossible manufacturer date of 1978. See screenshot. I’ve read that this is done by Apple to identify “gray market” devices, devices refurbished by unauthorized resellers, and iPhones that were demo units. This makes me wary that this phone may have been tampered with, compromised, or hacked. Like I said it is cosmetically in perfect condition, I was even impressed! But I have to return this phone and buy brand new for my peace of mind. Since it might just be my paranoia, I’m only knocking off one star. This renewed phone is for someone, just not me.","R31XKWUIZ0YWHT","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61iO+JxfYFL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,"7","Tampered with — made in 1978","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31XKWUIZ0YWHT","Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2022","16635","638",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: White, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PPDJWC8","Size","128GB","Color","White","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

Purchased in September 2024. The touchscreen didn’t seem sensitive enough. I tried changing settings, but still bothersome, especially around the edges. After warranty was out, several issues began with the battery. The first month or so, it required charging twice a day, with or without excessive use. I liked the size so much and the fact text messaging was a breeze, I tolerated it. December 2024- Then the battery began getting really hot. The touchscreen stopped responding. I removed the cover and even took the screen protector off (I was panicking)! I forced it to power down. After powering up again, I ran it in low power mode, which seemed to help and kept the phone functional. January 2025 - The phone would say it wasn’t charged, plug in and it indicated 70 - 89% charged; unplug, 2 -3%. Phone gave a message: Battery not recognized. Look in explanation, the battery is not Apple and may be incompatible. Next day, thankfully, it upgrades. Since then, screen sensitivity is much better and the battery seems ok. It doesn’t need charging as often. I just really enjoy that text messages are sent and received so easily and I don’t feel like I’m carrying around a mammoth of a phone. It also seems faster on the internet. Those are the reasons that I gave 2 stars. Also, it’s in a case and the screen has several cracks, from low level drops. This might be an Apple issue. The only other electronic device that I own that has cracked, is an iPad. No cracks on any of my android refurbished phones. In fact, I still have two around the house to use for shopping, internet searches, etc. This may just be the “luck of the draw” and I just happened to get a lemon. I’m going to try to limp along until at least a year, just to not feel too bad about spending the money. But when I buy, it will DEFINITELY be Android!","RTPC129BU5QVX",,,,,,,,,"Beware of BATTERY!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTPC129BU5QVX","Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2025","16635","394",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Black, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PPDJWC8","Size","128GB","Color","Black","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

First and foremost, it's important to note that my unit had a replacement screen. While the screen works fine, I can’t help but wonder if it impacts the phone's overall performance and longevity. One of the most common complaints I read in other reviews was about the battery life, and I have to agree. The battery doesn't last as long as I hoped. Even with moderate use, I find myself needing to charge it more frequently than my previous phones. For a device that promises portability and convenience, having to carry a charger around somewhat defeats the purpose. Additionally, I noticed that the phone had a few scratches on the body when I received it. While these are mostly cosmetic issues, they were disappointing to see on a relatively new device. It's something to keep in mind if you're considering purchasing a refurbished or pre-owned model. In summary, while the iPhone 12 Mini is compact and offers the usual Apple quality in terms of user experience, the battery life and the condition of the phone I received were letdowns. If battery longevity and pristine condition are important to you, you might want to consider other options or ensure you buy from a reputable source that guarantees the condition of the device. I ended up returning the phone.","RYYTCL62Z68KI",,,,,,,,"2","Used iPhone 12 Mini","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYYTCL62Z68KI","Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2024","16635","394",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Blue, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PPDJWC8","Size","128GB","Color","Blue","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

I purchased a phone from amazon (amazon renewed) in May of 2024 to use for developing a new app. I did not (at that time) need to connect it to a cellular network, so I did not. On that front the phone is great: fully functional, great physical shape, and the settings showed that it was carrier unlocked, as expected. January of 2024, I'm at a point where it does need service, and after several days and efforts, I find that while it's unlocked, it only works on T-mobile's network. So not what I wanted, not what I was expecting, and not what I paid for. However, I should have checked half a year ago during the return window. It's a learning experience. When you get a renewed phone, make sure what you bought matches what you were sold.","R38ZDRBX1C9I67",,,,,,,,,"Be careful with your purchase","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38ZDRBX1C9I67","Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2025","16635","394",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Blue, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PPDJWC8","Size","128GB","Color","Blue","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

I understood that with the purchase of a used device that there would be typical wear and tear associated with use and I was not expecting a pristine condition phone by any means. I purchased the “Excellent condition” option available for the product. This option provided several assurances: 1) The screen would be free of scratches. 2) the body would have no signs of cosmetic damage visible within 12 inches and 3) the battery would be fully functional and above 80% battery life. I did not receive that product. The screen had a substantial and tangible scratch across the lower half of the screen. I thought it was strange the iPhone came with a screen protector already installed, but I suspect this was placed to cover the deep scratch below. The camera plate around the rear camera lens was covered in visible scratches and dents around the bezel of lenses. Functionally, the phone was in good condition. The battery life is at 84%. There does not seem to be anything electronically or mechanically wrong with the device. The camera works great and there does not appear to be any internal problems with the iOS or processor. If I had received this product with purchase under “Acceptable condition”, then I imagine be happier with the purchase. I wanted to try to refund/replace the item, but I really could not afford to be without a phone through the refund process, so I decided to keep the device. However, I advise caution for those with high expectations looking to purchase this product in the future.","RPHWKAD9QFXYA","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61mQm-5E5aL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71m2f1vwdsL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71tnqxSH7fL._SY88.jpg",,,,,"4","Manage your expectations with this purchase","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPHWKAD9QFXYA","Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2023","16635","394",,,"Size: 64GB, Color: Black, Service Provider: Verizon, Product grade: Renewed","B08PPDJWC8","Size","64GB","Color","Black","Service Provider","Verizon","Product grade","Renewed"

On many pages it takes multiple swipes to find the sweet spot to exit the page, especially on pages that load extra content at the bottom, such as chat boxes, advertisements, etc. The email app is especially difficult to exit. The extra screen space gained by eliminating the lower bar for the home button is negated by the annoyance level of an unresponsive new feature.

Despite using a screen protector, the display broke easily, and I ended up having to replace it twice within just a few months. To add to the frustration, the fragility of the screen caused me to lose the Face ID feature. Ultimately, I decided to upgrade to either the iPhone 13 or 14 because I couldn't rely on the 12 Mini anymore. While the phone has some good qualities, the screen issues really overshadow them. I wouldn't recommend the iPhone 12 Mini to anyone looking for durability.

It’s not exclusive to any app. I often have to close an app and restart it when it freezes. The phone is usable and at first I believed maybe there was an issue with the apps I’m using, but then it happened with every single app. I desperately needed to stay connected, and therefore can’t just send the phone in and demand a replacement.

It wasn't a total disaster, but overall I would not do it again. The iPhone 12 mini we ordered was in pretty good cosmetic condition. However, there were two main drawbacks. The batter capacity was less than 80% of the original for that model. So battery life wasn't great. The other issue was that the original glass on the screen seems to have been replaced at some point in the past. The surface of the screen wasn't flush with the body, sticking up above the sides of the phone. And the glass was low quality. It cracked within a few months of pretty light usage without any serious drops.","R1R2HUSQKM2M07",,,,,,,,,"Disappointing battery life and screen quality","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1R2HUSQKM2M07","Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2024","16635","394",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: (Product)Red, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PPDJWC8","Size","128GB","Color","(Product)Red","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

I can no longer use my data, make or receive phone calls. I thik it is a software issue as it happened as soon as I downloaded the update. I tried to get it repaired but it was more expensive than the phone instead. It is very frustrating to have so many problems with the phone so soon after buying it.

About 6 months later, the phone was not working again. $220 later, we had a new lightning connector assembly and another new battery. So this $320 phone has turned into a $610 phone.

Yesterday I stopped by my local phone repair store and paid them to put on a screen protector. They couldn’t get their brand of screen protector to seal all the way around either. I was then informed that my problem was I was sold a phone with a bent frame. Now I need to change my poor review I gave the screen protector seller. Whoops.

So the bottom line is I spent almost $400 for the ""renewed"" iPhone in Dec. In July apple repaired and replaced all of the internal components, everything new except the camera and casing ""renewed"" for an additional $300.

Ordering refurbished phones from Amazon has never been an issue, and I desperately needed a new one. When I got the iPhone, it wasn't even that secure in its box. I could hear and feel it move around, which didn't make me feel good knowing what I had spent. The phone is currently in the mail being returned because the battery was either no good or not an Apple battery. I had a flurry of alerts pop up when I turned it on, saying there was a ""foreign part identified"" as the battery part. Within the first day, I was already having issues. The battery wouldn't hold a charge and would restart every few minutes. Even a 2-minute phone call was difficult because the phone kept restarting. I suppose there is an essential lesson in this: it pays to get New sometimes because it will last you in the long run.

I’ve been through four of these phones in a couple months, and they have all had major issues from Camera not working to audio issues, and the worst of all one COMPLETELY DIED after four months. Unfortunately, the Amazon warranty is only three months. (I thought it was one year because other competitors offer that. But it does clearly say on their page that it’s only three months.) During these three months, they to completely refund you no problem or fix the issue that you report. But unfortunately the phone I kept died on month four, while I was on vacation to make matters worse. Seems like the sellers are always different stores, but all amazon approved and they follow some sort of Amazon standards for these phones. But it seems to me that these phones have really severe issues so these Amazon sellers fix the phones to a certain standard, but they are not in good condition. All the sellers are polite and responsive, but the issue is the actual phones and their conditions. Even though these phones are used, they are not cheap, they should function properly. I’ve been an Amazon customer for years and I really haven’t had any issue with them. That was the reason why I decided to buy the used phone on Amazon instead of a competitor. But this is truly disappointing to the point that I think I’m going to report them to the Better Business Bureau. They should not be selling phones in this condition.

But as soon as I put a case on it, a lot of little pieces of paint started coming off of it and then you could tell it had a lot of scratches on the case so somebody was trying to cover the scratches, then I put a screen protector on it, and after trying to I could not get rid of a humongous huge bubble, took a third of the screen. So some thing was hinting to me that the screen was not straight. In my opinion, the phone shouldn’t have been sold as good condition with so many scratches but since I don’t care about the look as much as functionality, I move forward. But then, after a few weeks of using the phone, I realized things were not working properly. The camera was very slow at taking pictures if it was dark or if you were using inside the message or WhatsApp. Also, if I received a text while listening to videos or video calls, the speaker would suddenly gets super low, and I could barely hear the video for about two minutes . (usually this lowering of audio feature happens only for five or 10 seconds). This was worrying me so I contacted the seller and told him I wanted to change the phone and he said no problem. Since I was still thinking that this was bad luck, but in general, I liked the iPhone 12 I decided to buy another phone as a replacement, and one more phone as a Christmas gift. I’ll explain below the problems with those phones, but since the problems were actually worse than the current first phone I had in my possession, I never gave back this phone. I kept thinking that maybe the issues would get better with update and also, in my mind, I thought I had a year warranty. Unfortunately, in February while away on vacation the phone one morning, simply never turned on again. My dad is an engineer and he tried helping me connect it to computer and nothing it’s like the battery is no longer connected. I’m sure you can imagine the horrendous time I had the following week without my phone., traveling.. Things got worse when I got home and was able to contact the seller. I then discovered the warranty was only 90 days and that date had passed. After some back-and-forth the seller Kojak sales said they can fix it for $39 and I pay for shipping. I have still not done this since I’m skeptical and don’t understand how they can give me a price if they don’t even know the actual problem or if they need parts. But I really have no other option, or I lose $241 or I pay $60 more. (also, I have to figure out how to erase the phone from a PC if the phone doesn’t even turn on. I’m sad I’m gonna lose all my pictures from the last four months) After I send them the phone, I will update this review. -Phone 2 and 3- iPhone 12 mini (Ordered good condition ) Received Mid begging of december Seller: Wilzee So one of these phones was supposed to be replacement for my phone and the second phone was gonna be a Christmas gift. But the first one was so scratch that I didn’t even set it up and I gave it back, no problem and the other phone after giving it as a gift, a little embarrassed with all the scratches, we set it up and realized the camera did not focus at all so I also gave this phone back and received a refund no issue. -4th Phone- iPhone 12 mini (Ordered EXCELLENT condition ) Received mid January Seller: PDI Mobile This phone did actually look really good in the outside barely any scratches. I was very happy with the look. But after setting it up again, the camera could not focus so we contacted the seller and sent it back and they fix the camera then after a few weeks of using also, it has audio issues. We’re looking at social media videos suddenly that audio lowers a lot. Since at this my 1st phone died suddenly we decided to give this 4th phone back. I don’t wanna take any chances since the quality of the phones is clearly not good. I don’t expect an issue with the refund. But I will update this review if I do.","R2ABMWFDI53IXE",,,,,,,,"112","DON’T BUY IT","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ABMWFDI53IXE","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025","16635","1348",,,"Size: 256GB, Color: Blue, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PPDJWC8","Size","256GB","Color","Blue","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

It didn't die exactly but the battery started swelling. And then I found out it was at risk of blowing up in my face. Literally. Naturally I needed a new phone ASAP so I could transfer all the data from my old phone before it went off like a bomb. I didn't want to pay a ton of money for a new phone, I don't mind pre-owned stuff, and I like giving things a new life. So I got this. After the order being delayed several times my new (to me) iPhone finally arrived. I opened the package and was surprised to see that the phone was black; not red as it said it was. I was slightly taken aback but I was fine with a different color especially since I didn't want the hassle of returning it and ordering a new one. Not what was advertised but not a huge deal. I then began to transfer the data from old phone to new. When it was all set up and ready for use I opened the camera to see how much better it was then my iPhone 8's, only to see that it was as bad if not WORSE and it made a terrifying buzzing noise while trying to focus, which it couldn't. I was now certain I needed to return it, but just for funsies I decided to check the battery health. It was at 75% (below the guaranteed level) and said it needed servicing. I just returned the phone. This is more a review for the seller (Wireless Source) than it is for the general refurbished iPhone 12 mini as I know there are many different sellers selling the same product and quality varies quite a lot. I'd really like to give them the benefit of the doubt because it totally could have been just a fluke, but I won't ever feel confidant enough to order from that seller again. A word of advice. If you are buying a refurbished phone check the seller's rating over the past 12 months by clicking on 'Sold By: Whoever'. It could save you from a bad experience. I just ordered another refurbished iPhone 12 mini. I clicked on the seller before I hit proceed to check out and they had a 78% positive rating. Because of that I ended up getting one from a seller that had a 99% positive rating instead. TLDR: The phone was not how it was advertised, it was crappy, I returned it, I got another one from a better seller.","R4JKY35LTELKF",,,,,,,,"26","I'm very disappointed.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4JKY35LTELKF","Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2024","16635","1348",,,"Size: 256GB, Color: Red, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PPDJWC8","Size","256GB","Color","Red","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

So I have two children and wanted to upgrade their phones. Being that they are kids I got them renewed phones. I got the phones in. They are supposed to have 80% of the original battery health life. They used it to stream audio for 4 hours and they were then down to 20%. No video, no other applications going. Even if you doubled the 4 hours you would still be only barely making the lowest estimate. I messaged the sellers. They offered to refund, replace, or give me a $15 credit so -I- could go get the batteries replaced. Both phones had the problem so replacement didn't seem wise. Refunding would leave me with my kids not having a phone until I got them replacements because I had already recycled their old ones. Oh, and the battery replacement is $89 - EACH... to use the warranty it would cost me $39 (each) - on a week old phone... So I thought ask for the $39 and pay the difference out of pocket since insurance would laugh at me doing a claim with a WEEK OLD EXCELLENT CONDITION PHONE. They might even cancel my plan for fraud. The seller said no, and reminded me I could simply return or replace them. I could, but then my kids wouldn't have communications for an unknown amount of time and for their safety I found that unacceptable. MAYBE the phone you get will be better - I got two with the same problem. MAYBE you won't need to use the warranty - I wouldn't think you would have to even consider it the first week.... the phones LOOK pretty, no scratches or screen cracks or whatever - and when I called them on the whole battery thing they DID fulfill their requirements for Amazon A to Z - but sometimes doing only what is requirred isn't kosher / right given the situation... and I was stupid enough to recycle their old phones so quickly... just know that sometimes spending some extra money from a different seller might be worth it, because I will be spending $178 more. Oh, and I didn't take their $30 ($15 for each) - sometimes it isn't about the money, but the principle.","R3SVSZB6RHMU7V",,,,,,,,"21","FIND A DIFFERENT SELLER - MODEL OF PHONE IS GREAT","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3SVSZB6RHMU7V","Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2024","16635","1348",,,"Size: 256GB, Color: Black, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PPDJWC8","Size","256GB","Color","Black","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

Even more concerning, they explicitly stated they have no obligation to disclose non-original parts in their product listings—that it is amazon's responsibility.

The moment the return date expired, the battery of this phone mysteriously stopped working, rendering it completely useless. It's truly disheartening to experience such a malfunction after only a week of usage after return date has passed. The final blow came when the battery completely died and refused to charge, no matter what I tried. I attempted different charging cables, wall adapters, and even tried charging it from my laptop, but the phone remained lifeless. As a consumer, I expect reliability and quality from the products I purchase, especially when they come with positive reviews and reputable branding. However, this particular phone failed to meet even the most basic expectations. It not only failed in terms of performance but also fell short in terms of durability and longevity. Moreover, the timing of this battery failure seems highly suspicious. It is incredibly frustrating that the issue manifested itself just after the return date had passed. It raises questions about the quality control and the integrity of the product itself. I am left wondering if this was a deliberate ploy to ensure customers are left with defective products beyond the return window. I must emphasize my profound disappointment and advise potential buyers to exercise caution before purchasing this particular phone. While it may initially appear appealing and have decent features, the lack of reliability and the unpleasant customer experience I encountered cannot be ignored. I sincerely hope that others will be spared the frustration and inconvenience that I have endured. I have reached out to Amazon's customer service regarding this matter, hoping for a resolution. However, based on this experience, my trust in the brand has been significantly diminished. I will be considering alternative options in the future to avoid a repeat of this ordeal. In conclusion, my recent phone purchase has left me feeling disgusted and thoroughly dissatisfied. The untimely failure of the battery, just after the return date had expired, raises serious concerns about the product's quality and the overall experience provided. It is regrettable that what seemed like a promising investment turned into a waste of both time and money.","R17392KUYL4OB7","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61eues5lGmL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,"49","Worst scam ever!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R17392KUYL4OB7","Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2023","16635","1348",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Black, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PPDJWC8","Size","128GB","Color","Black","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

I'm going to probably submit a return and get a refund while I'm within the 30 days, since this product does not function despite being ""Excellent"" quality. Sorely disappointed this one passed any sort of quality inspection.","R386GV4LOMK4FN",,,,,,,,"6","Does not work.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R386GV4LOMK4FN","Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2025","16635","1348",,,"Size: 64GB, Color: White, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PPDJWC8","Size","64GB","Color","White","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

After receiving the refurbished phone, the problems started before the phone setup process was even initiated. The screen and buttons only decided to work when it wanted to, ""red flag"" but I tried to make it work. However right out of the box the phone was turned on and ready to use as if someone else already set it up, ""red flag #2"" because the phone should have been factory reset. The face recognition was immediately unusable due to the camera depth sensor not working. I was hoping this phone would allow me to not have to buy something brand new that cost at least $1000 - but I was wrong to think that. After both buttons and screen not functioning properly, the phone set-up was not able to be completed and the phone itself was not processing at the same speed that a regular iphone 12 mini should function. I was very disappointed that the phone was not functional because the body of the phone itself looked almost new. I'm sure this product is only as good as your luck and you may receive a better renewed phone than I did but it just isn't worth the hassle for me and I would definitely not buy again.","RLRNAPS7O49XK",,,,,,,,"8","Too good to be true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RLRNAPS7O49XK","Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2024","16635","1348",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Green, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PPDJWC8","Size","128GB","Color","Green","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

Two factor is an absolute nightmare. Tried turning it on a few weeks ago, to give it a try, and got stuck in an instant, endless verification loop between iPad and iPhone. If I didn’t have the iPad on me at all times to verify iPhone unlocks, I would be locked out of my iPhone. It was literally a consecutive, never ending loop of non-functionality. About biweekly, Apple locks account (despite 100% consistently correct password inputs). Across those three devices, I get asked randomly for AppleID at least 10 times per week; Apple's like an additional add-on to current the spam phone call landscape. I absolutely dread initiating any Apple updates, since they're constantly changing/ taking away prominent features I once enjoyed and found convenient. The updates are impossible to ignore, since they send never ending forced notifications for system updates, despite cycles not salient for security reasons. Just changing stuff to change stuff.. iOS 10: can no longer swipe-to-switch watch faces is the last straw.. and I’m refusing to do the currently available Bing Chat/Reddit workaround. Completely switching to Samsung and Android devices; this user has had enough.. I'm out of this ""only our way"" ecosystem; which hasn't made sense since the first few iPhone iterations. Their way has been consistently dumb; changing convenient features just for the sake of change is stupid.

My daughter spent several months saving her money for a “refurbished” phone. After a lot of research she landed on this iPhone 12 mini. It was supposed to be in excellent condition. Right out of the box, the device exhibited difficulty in charging: known good cords wouldn’t charge it. As I was getting ready to send it back, it started charging normally again. As I looked further into this, the battery health was a disappointing 85%. I would’ve expected with an “excellent” condition phone that it would’ve had a new battery. Recently, the phone wouldn’t turn on. At all. Known good chargers/cords wouldn’t work at all. We finally took it into a shop today who told us the board was toast. This is extremely disappointing after only 5 months of use. I generally have a rule about electronics and not buying them used unless I can put my hands on them first. But I realize that’s somewhat unreasonable for a child, so I relented. Lesson learned for both her and I. I certainly won’t be buying from this company again, and won’t buy used electronics from Amazon again.","R30JAIJJE0JSD3",,,,,,,,"8","Dead after 5 months - you get what you pay for","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30JAIJJE0JSD3","Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2024","16635","1348",,,"Size: 256GB, Color: White, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PPDJWC8","Size","256GB","Color","White","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

I uploaded a short video clip. It shakes just as much when taking stills (image is blurry) so that camera is completely unusable. So... I contacted BuySPRY and after days delay getting back to me said Amazon is responsible for returns and refunds. K. Got in touch with Amazon. We were offered a 20 dollar credit or full refund when phone is returned. That's fine if it's a kitchen widget you use once a month but not good if it's a phone you use many times a day. It's more than inconvenient to be without a phone for days. I think they should have sent us a replacement and then we would have sent in the faulty phone to avoid being without a phone. They certainly have the capacity to bill us again if we failed to return the faulty phone.

It wasn't able to maintain a steady image and when the camera app was open, the phone would make a very disconcerting electrical crackling sound. Returned. Phone 4: battery health was 93%. When making phone calls via speakerphone, the microphone stopped working. Went to an Apple store and they identified a hardware issue that would have cost $300 to fix. By the fourth phone, I was done and got a refund. I also noticed that the price for the iPhone 12 Mini refurbished went *up* by almost $50 compared to when I initially ordered a new phone in early November. How does that make any sense???

Since I was out of the country, they said the best refund they could offer me was $27, which is RIDICULOUS. When I complained, they said that electronic devices were unpredictable, which makes no sense. SELLING FAULTY PRODUCTS AND THEN REFUSING TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY IS UNACCEPTABLE. I PAID FULL PRICE FOR A WORKING PRODUCT, NOT FOR A SCAM. THIS FEELS LIKE A COMPLETE RIP-OFF.

I wanted to go from one phone provider to another and needed a 5G unlocked phone with 128gb to do it. I found this phone and thought I had what I needed. I received the phone within two days of ordering and I determined to prepare for the conversion. I synced the new phone with my existing iPhone and then went to the new service provider to transfer the service. We found out quickly that what should have been a part of the phone that was tested probably wasn’t even looked at! The bottom right quadrant of the touchscreen did not respond to ANY kind of touch. That stopped me or the service person from logging in, choosing options or basically communicating with the phone. I had already spent $50 for the SIM chip. $50 I will never get back. We couldn’t activate the phone. I ended up floating between two phone services. I asked to return the phone for a refund. I am still trying to wipe my information off of it. I get to the point where it says that they have had a problem and try later!! Basically, this purchase has cost me a minimum of $50 and untold hours of my time. Still haven’t gotten to the finish. Finally purchased a new iPhone. Figured it would really be cheaper in the long run!!","R35MMF87IT3VDR",,,,,,,,"13","RUN!!

The first was 64GB and White from PDI mobile. It didn't have great battery health, but it was still decent, so it would last me about 75% of the day without needing charge. However, the ultimate reason why I returned it was due to the regular angle camera never focusing, so pictures were always blurry. This was returned and fully refunded. The second one was 128GB and White from iBlueberry and bought as a replacement to the first. It started out mostly fine except it would occasionally completely power off and restart. While mildly annoying, it was manageable until it would happen more and more frequently as time went on. It got to the point where the phone was restarting about 20 times a day. Additionally, when this would happen, the battery would drop from 60-90% to 10%. Most recently, I have been leaving it charging for hours/overnight and the phone would attempt to restart but never fully turn on. A return is currently being processed.","R3TA6E3NHY9J2O",,,,,,,,"4","Poor battery health and bad cameras","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3TA6E3NHY9J2O","Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2024","16635","1348",,,"Size: 64GB, Color: White, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PPDJWC8","Size","64GB","Color","White","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

Of course, I didn't read anything negative about it in my research until AFTER my return/refund timeframe was long past. This version has issues with sensitivity, something about the model of the phone, and not the OS so it's basically not fixable. MY phone, not only has sensitivity issues, it has functioning issues all the way around. It doesn't ring when it should, If it's on silent, it doesn't vibrate with every call, I have it set to dark mode, yet at least once a week, half of my apps are in light and the rest are in dark, the fun features like the tapping for the flashlight doesn't work unless it's accidental, the screen blacks out in the middle of a call so I can't even hang up or enter a number for an automated call, and the list goes on and on. If I were only dealing with the sensitivity part, I'd just chalk it up to poor research on my part and move on. But I really think I got a POC phone with ALL the issues. I've only used iPhone since the switch to smart phones, for various reasons, but this experience will have me trying something new in the not too distant future.

This was entirely wrong. because the only reason it was returned is because it did not work as promised, thus no restocking fee should have been assessed. Amazon has now contacted the seller on my behalf three times after they refused to write me back, and there still has not been a response.

The phone was fine the first few months after receiving it. After about three months a small black spot appeared on the right corner of my screen, Initially I thought it was just a dead pixel but then it started to get bigger. I read online it's an issue with the glue that holds the screen and I will eventually have to get it replaced. Then the facial recognition stopped working out of nowhere, and now the phone is just blinking the apple logo and won't turn on. For the price of the phone, I thought it was a good deal, but overall it's lasted me less than six months. I haven't dropped this phone once, or damaged it in any way. Every issue I've had so far just appeared out of nowhere. Really strange to me, but I wouldn't recommend this product.","R1558HPYQDQ0OM",,,,,,,,"3","Good price, weird problems","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1558HPYQDQ0OM","Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2024","16635","1348",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: (Product)Red, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PPDJWC8","Size","128GB","Color","(Product)Red","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

The first phone I ordered was lost in the mail and I had to fight with multiple amazon customer service employees and the seller to get it re-shipped. I was promised money off for having to wait months for the phone and that was a lie, no discount was ever provided. I’m now on phone number 4. Just set it up and already have to return it for touch screen issues and the front camera is broken somehow and light is coming out of it. The other 3 I had to exchange because they froze up constantly and the battery would get extremely hot when charging. It was unusable when charging. This newest one is starting to have that issue too. Absolutely no way anyone is checking the quality of these phones before sending out. The people with positive reviews just got lucky.

I was never told when it was processed, never received updates on location for the product and I paid two day shipping. While Amazon maintained the idea that it would be delivered on the 6th at 10pm, I was never told when it was even out for delivery! I was at college in the middle of class at 6:45pm when it was dropped off. I know and realize that they did complete the agreement of 2 day shipping but I ordered the phone at the end of February and they couldn’t process or ship it until the Friday BEFORE the deadline? Kinda ridiculous that I even paid two day at that point. I would ask for a refund but they fulfilled their contract with little time to spare, but it’s complete none the less. As for the phone: All in all, for a refurbished mini, I expected the battery life to be equal if not a little less than my current SE (2nd gen). I was right as it arrived with 86%. Not awful, what I’m used to. The phone works well and runs as smooth as I could have hoped. Set up between two iPhones is a breeze now and I highly recommend the direct transfer over the iCloud if you’re someone like me who has had Apple devices since 2011 (I don’t need to text my peers from high school or my ex boss…). The color purple was stunning and everything I wanted! No dings or dents in the body or on the screen. I have loved this phone since it came out as I have tiny hands and gripping this phone makes it feel like I have normal sized hands! To summarize: The phone is great, the processing and order fulfillment barely passed requirements with a lack of communication. For an expensive purchase, I expect to get updates as regularly as I do my weights I ordered.","R146EJIAK7T429",,,,,,,,"21","My only issue was the lack of communication","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R146EJIAK7T429","Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2023","16635","463",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Purple, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PPDJWC8","Size","128GB","Color","Purple","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

All scratched up and if look very decently used. Did not care much, since I just want to use it as dashcam. Battery was at 100%- meaning it was replaced. Good and bad... since I got a message that the camera was not genuine also. So phone was damaged. Camera and battery were replaced. Problem is they got replaced with non-genuine parts. While I have nothing against aftermarket parts when I have to replace them, I have an issue when someone sells something and not disclosing that. I would rather have an old non genuine battery than a new aftermarket. Also the way Apple has been working lately what's from stopping them disabling my non genuine camera. They try doing it before I believe people were outraged and they stopped and even a law- The right to repair was also introduced because of that. Either way bought another refurb phone after returning this one. That one I got it with the lowest possible condition- ""acceptable"" or something. Also, the cheapest. Honestly as far as scratches they look identical. This one battery was at 88%- so it hasn't been replaced and no messages about non genuine parts. So I guess my advice would be to go in with a lot of expectations about these and my opinion just get the cheapest possible. Chances are you will still get the same condition unit.","R389AVMQ5V15NQ",,,,,,,,"27","Scratched, many parts have been replaced with aftermarket","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R389AVMQ5V15NQ","Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2024","16635","463",,,"Size: 64GB, Color: Blue, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PPDJWC8","Size","64GB","Color","Blue","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

Never had a better phone. But my takeaway from this experience is to order ""renewed premium"" for electronics from amazon rather than ""renewed,"" for one reason (buried in the fine print of course.) ""Renewed premium"" gives you the buyer 12 months of satisfaction guaranteed coverage, whereas ""renewed"" gives you a mere 3 months of the same. My phone had not been abused or subjected to moisture in any way shape or form, so 4 months of cellphone service for $240 feels suboptimal, when paying slightly more for a whole year of coverage would be much less so. I'm now tasked with ""repairing"" a phone i've owned for less than 4 months and now need to repair or replace at my expense. I did nothing negligent (water damage, dropping it, etc) to get to this point.

Here is my complaint and it's a big one. After activating the phone on my network, i checked the battery life and it was at 73%, Renewed Premium phones are supposed to have a battery life of at least 90%. I ended up spending an additional $89.99 at Apple to replace the battery. It's obvious that Amazon is not checking the battery life on renewed phones or renewed Premium phones and the sellers know it. Very hard to return phone after you've activated it and switched all your iCloud data to new phone already.

Cons- Battery life is terrible, I have to charge it a few times a day. When I got it the maximum capacity was at either 84-86%, now it’s at 80%. Camera isn’t that great, photos look dull like there’s no color saturation. Laggy at times with loading, whether I switch between WiFi or phone service it’s the same.

However, the Battery Health max capacity was at 85%. Normally this should be fine, but with average use, I need to charge it 2 times a day. I've cleared out apps that were possibly running/draining in the background, but that only made a minimal impact. I've had the phone less than a week and now the Battery Health maximum capacity dropped to 84%, so I have no idea if this will survive without the need for a new battery. That's pretty disappointing considering I am switching from an iPhone Xs that should have a worse battery capacity and health yet stays charged with the same use all day. Everything else appears to be working just fine. Shipping was slow, but was stated in the order estimate. It arrived 1 day later than the 2-week delivery timeframe. I know this is the nature of ordering used, but was a disappointing experience.","R27ZK61YAZRYWO",,,,,,,,"4","Good physical condition / Diminished battery health","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27ZK61YAZRYWO","Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2023","16635","463",,,"Size: 256GB, Color: Red, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PPDJWC8","Size","256GB","Color","Red","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

I have not yet returned my old iPhone and may exchange or return this one. I haven’t decided yet. I am hoping that an update will fix the glitch. Maybe im delusional.

It was my business phone, and I just can't afford that happening. So I'll go directly to Apple from now on. Good luck to all buying a refurbished iPhone.
