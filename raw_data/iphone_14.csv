The overall condition was not as expected based on the listing. Functionality (4.5/5): On the positive side, the phone’s functionality was not compromised, and it works perfectly fine without any issues like sound quality. The performance is smooth, and all features are functioning as expected including charging. The only negative here was the battery health received was 90%. Suggestion: While the product works well, its appearance is something that can be reflected upfront. It would be beneficial for Amazon to provide exact pictures of the item they are selling in renewed condition. This transparency would help manage customer expectations better and prevent surprises upon delivery. In conclusion, while the iPhone 14 I received functions well, the discrepancy between the listed condition and actual product appearance was a downside.","R7OO5GVUZJMW7",,,,,,,,"7","Misleading Description.

It has the worst battery life of any iPhone I've ever owned, and I have owned ONLY iPhones since the first version was released 17 years ago. This is the second iPhone 14 that I've bought from the renewed store . The first one I bought on December 4th, 2023, and I could not have been happier with the phone. It arrived in brand new condition, and performed flawlessly. On the recommendation of a friend, I checked the battery health and charging after having it for MONTHS and it was at 100%! I was thrilled! I absolutely loved the phone! I never had a single problem with it. Unfortunately, on July 30 of this year I dropped it, and it was beyond repair. I immediately went back to the Amazon renewed store and purchased another iPhone 14 because my experience with the first one was so fantastic. It arrived in new looking condition, exactly like the one I bought in December 2023. It was not scratched or anything really noticeable, it just seemed to be ""worn"" a little bit, but I fully understood that it was a renewed phone, and any cosmetic issues were not that important to me, including the color, which, when my iPhone is in its case, you cannot tell what color it is anyway. Unfortunately, I DID NOT look at the battery health and charging when I first got the phone 38 days ago, but I did look at it about two weeks ago, and it said 93%. I thought, ok, it's a renewed phone, it's not going to have 100% battery life. I can live with that. Well, I just looked at it today and it's now at 90% battery health and charging. So this phone is dying quickly. After being fully charged it dies within hours. I have it completely set up for optimized battery life. I have lost emails and messages that I was in the middle of composing, and the phone just dies. I've been in the middle of important phone calls when the phone dies, simply because I had just fully charged it a few hours before that, and thought I would be fine for hours to come. I just had a total shoulder replacement surgery a week ago, and I was on the phone with my doctors office yesterday about my first post-op appointment, and my phone died in the middle of it. I thought I had HOURS left before the phone would die. Then I had to plug it in, and wait for it to come back alive, so I could call my doctor back and hopefully not wait a half hour after losing my place in line. On top of that is also has issues with the touchscreen being glitchy, and sometimes I have to tap on things several times to get them to work. As I said, I have been an iPhone owner/user since the very first version came out 17 years ago. I've always loved all my iPhones, and I will continue to be an iPhone user for the rest of my life. This is in no way reflection on Apple iPhones whatsoever. They are an amazing and fantastic piece of technology. I think I just got a bad one for the first time in my life. Luckily, I have just checked and I have until November 6th to return this phone, and I WILL be returning it. The problem is, what do I do in the meantime? Am I expected to buy a new one and get that shipped to me, transfer all my information from this phone to the new one, and then return this one? That is extremely hard to do financially! I am actually still paying for this phone on my Amazon Prime American Express card! Or, do I return this phone and wait until the refund has been issued and then buy another phone? Then wait until that is sent to me. I would not have a phone for at least a week in the interim, and we all know these days that's a practical impossibility. I am also having several medical issues. Like I said, I just had a total shoulder replacement surgery last Monday, September 9th, and have several upcoming follow up appointments, and physical therapy appointments. I also have several other non-related medical issues that definitely require that I have a phone. I just don't know what to do.","RSNNT7MIGKJWN",,,,,,,,"306","1st purchase was great!

We went to our wireless carrier to add her to my plan, and right off the bat, the phone was set to a different language. It took two employees 15 minutes just to switch it to English. We proceeded with transferring her phone number over and basic setup of the phone. When we got home, I created an Apple ID for her and tried to add her emai…then I saw a red notification in Settings that said, “Unknown Part.” Tapping it revealed a message stating “Unable to verify if display is a genuine Apple part.” Are you serious? So now, after spending my entire Sunday setting everything up, I’m going to have to undo it all and return this phone. I’m furious. Beyond furious. My mom doesn’t understand phone plans; my dad handled all of that, and he passed away recently. I added her to my plan to help her and to make sure that she has reliable way of communicating since I moved to Texas, and she’s back in California. We set up her phone during her one-week visit out here and she is set to fly home tomorrow. The phone is already tied to mine and my husbands plan, and her plan she had with my father is cancelled. And for anyone who has ever dealt with changes on a phone plan knows that the main account holder is the person who has to do everything. Which means I will need to send my mother home without a phone until we get a new phone and I drag my husband once again down to the store to connect the new phone, I’ll have to reset up the new phone and then mail it from Texas to her in California. And all the while, will have no way of contacting her… and she will have a phone to contact anyone. The fact that the phone was repaired using non-genuine Apple parts completely derailed everything. This wasn’t an accident—it was deliberate. The seller knowingly passed off a product with unauthorized repairs as a legitimate iPhone and charged accordingly. That’s not just misleading—it’s fraud. A simple refund isn’t enough. This seller should be removed from Amazon Prime, and Amazon needs to do a better job vetting Prime sellers. I’ve always trusted Amazon to ensure its Prime vendors are reputable, but clearly, that trust was misplaced. Lesson learned.","R23VVEP58Z1094","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51bJUJJNyGL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,"15","Non genuine Apple parts used to refurbish iPhone.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23VVEP58Z1094","Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2025","5662","586",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Midnight, Size: 128GB","B0BN72FYFG","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Midnight","Size","128GB"

However I needed to send my phone in first, before they would ship me a new one. I use my phone for work so this is a problem, but I can make it work for a few days. I'm told the turnaround is very fast too, so I figure I'm looking at a week maximum. Due to a tracking error on FedEx's end, it takes them longer to process my return, so it's nearly a week and a half before I get my new phone. And then when I get it, it's set up for TMobile, not AT&T so I can't even use it. And all attempts to call this week have been met with a message of ""no available agents, call back later"". They have been relatively fast to respond via email, but honestly, this has been such a mess I'm wishing I had just spent some extra money for a new phone. I know there is always a risk with refurb items, but I've rarely had issue and when I do they are resolved quickly. I purchased a refurbished iPhone 14 in August of last year and it was working great with no issues. It was a like new phone. However, in the last few days I've started getting ""Unknown Battery"" messages and my phone will turn off at random multiple times throughout the day, to the point where I don't feel confident making phone calls with the phone for fear of them being dropped. I went back to the order to see what my options were in terms of warranty and tech support, and it's EXTREMELY convoluted. It's hard for me to even tell if I qualify for the 90 day guarantee or the 1 year, because my phone was classified as ""new"" but the Amazon site only lists guarantees for conditions which are premium, excellent, or acceptable. When I tried to chat with someone I found my message was sent over to Loop Mobile, who must be the third party company who actually refurbished the phone. But it's unclear who I need to contract to see how to get this fixed or if I just need to pay out of pocket. I haven't even had the phone a year, so it's a disappointing development for what has otherwise been a great phone.","RZ4LZ886UBG38",,,,,,,,"31","Overall very good, but if you need tech support it becomes a pain","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZ4LZ886UBG38","Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2024","5662","586",,,"Service Provider: AT&amp;T, Color: Midnight, Size: 128GB","B0BN72FYFG","Service Provider","AT&amp;T","Color","Midnight","Size","128GB"

Even if you pay more for the “excellent” condition version, this does not fully mean the device you will receive is in excellent condition. I ordered an iPhone 14 and after a day after unboxing I realized that the charging port was faulty. At first I thought it wasn’t charging because it was in set up mode, but turns out it didn’t work in Bernal even after trying several phone chargers. How can the seller consider the iPhone in excellent condition and held by Amazon Renewed standards when a major component of the device doesn’t work. I had to use the MagSafe wireless charging to keep the device charged, which required me to buy the alternative charger. Communicating with the seller about an exchange felt like a void. It took a month to “resolve” which ended with me sending back the phone and the seller, without notice or explanation, issuing a refund instead of the exchange we agreed on. When I asked why, they said they “ran out”, but somehow I was able to reorder the exact model and specs IPhone right after our exchange, which costed me $10more. I still haven’t received the phone, but will update with another review once I receive the second device. Overall, budget customer service and inconsistent quality. I would avoid this seller, particularly for iPhone renewed devices, altogether if you value your time and effort.","R2Q283FK4C2U4O",,,,,,,,"6","Consider other sellers with better consistency and quality","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2Q283FK4C2U4O","Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2025","5662","586",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Blue, Size: 256GB","B0BN72FYFG","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Blue","Size","256GB"

I also contacted Amazon support at least five times, and they refused to help because I used a freight forwarder to bring the phone to Costa Rica — even though I followed Amazon’s process and the product was sold as “new.” I now have a $358 paperweight.

I paid for excellent condition and the edge of the body (right against the screen which was obviously a gnarly drop that led to a screen replacement) has very visible gouges and a slight gap/separation in the edge between the body and screen. Excellent condition promises no visible (from 12 inches away) cosmetic issues or damage. This is very visible at 36 inches, let alone 12. The slight separation between body edge and screen makes me nervous about the phone’s water resistance and any other potentially compromised internal components from what was clearly a high drop. I kept it because it seems to work electronically and falls within the promised battery health range at 85%. I am mostly afraid to return it and gamble getting a different one that is in worse condition.

I purchased the Asurion insurance for $170 and that was a joke. It took 2 hours to file a claim because they didn’t have a yellow IPhone 14 listed as a product in their system. Finally got the claim filed. Do I get a replacement? No I pay $99 and get a shipping label to return the phone to them. They will send me an Amazon gift card for the cost of phone minus taxes.

I started the return and dropped the package off 4 days ago, and I still haven't received the Amazon credit. 3very return I have ever made with Amazon has put the credit directly on the account shortly after checking in the product at return counter.

As soon as I upgraded IOS started alerting me that the camera was not identified as apple certified. I power cycled, searched for updates etc but the alert stayed. This was not an insignificant amount of money and it was identified as an apple iphone 14. Nowhere did it state that non apple certified parts were used. I reached out to vendor and if they contact me back and correct the issue I will adjust that part of the rating and update the review but at this point they still have not contacted me.

However, the bubble under the second scratch is a small scratch/crack creating said bubble. Not only is it easy to tell the phone was dropped repeatedly, it wasn’t recognized as an apple product and locked my eSIM. Took about 30 minutes to contact my carrier and get it unlocked. When it locked it also locked me out of my old phone preventing me from making any calls. I couldn’t even contact my carrier, I had to use someone else’s phone. Oh, and I still can’t connect my eSIM to it; I have to go in person for that.

While I appreciate the quick turn around on my order and delivery, the device had issues. For starters, the refurbished one I ordered and received took a long time to set up. You couldn’t just pair it with another device to get everything transferred. If you tried this, you would see the latest update would take days to complete and the timeline never changed. I reached out to apple and they helped me get it set up, however, there were several performance issues with the device I received. Total time it took to get the phone set up: 6.5 hours. Details: Started at 4pm as soon as the device was delivered, and after seeing the update was still not completed around 9pm, I worked with Apple support to get the device finally set up around 10pm. Performance issues: The charging port was loose, so even if the device was connected to a plug in charger, it wouldn’t always charge. This also impacted connection to CarPlay when driving. The phone would be sitting in the seat beside me, plugged in, but if it moved slightly, the connection wouldn’t work and I’d have to unplug it and plug it back in. It’s not tight enough to keep a good connection. There was an issue with screen responsiveness and phantom typing. If you needed to tap or select anything closer to the edge of the screen, it wouldn’t register. At times the screen wouldn’t respond at all, or if it was face down and I picked it up, I would see it was randomly typing characters in the Home Screen search box. I would have to manually turn the screen off (side button) for it to stop. There was also an issue with the front facing camera and sensor. The camera was really fuzzy and not able to pick up anything at times. The sensor wouldn’t always correctly adjust the screen brightness over the night I had it. The physical device itself also has scratches and dents all over it. While I don’t care about cosmetic as much as the above, the phone I received was more along the lines of poor condition overall. For this seller, I think it would be a good idea to do more intensive performance testing with the phones/devices before you send them out. You should also include correct setup instructions with the devices so your customers can set them running with ease and not have to waste half a day trying to get the phone setup to work. Overall, with the issues and hassle I experienced with the device I was sent, it was more cost effective to go buy the same model in new condition for the additional $100 at a local Best Buy.","R2QPMHNZOEH234",,,,,,,,"2","Better off getting a new one","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QPMHNZOEH234","Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2024","5662","148",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Blue, Size: 128GB","B0BN72FYFG","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Blue","Size","128GB"

When I looked at my phone, it was in SOS mode. Talks with customer reps from our service provider, Tello, and later Xfinity, I was informed that my refurbished, unlocked phone used to be with Verizon and Verizon locked it. No additional details on why; however, since it was working for some time, Xfinity customer rep surmised that previous owner must have reported it lost or stolen. These are the typical reasons for why phone would be locked. I chose to get a brand new phone from service provider for expediency, as I don't have a landline nor another mobile phone to use. As of Dec 11, I have a new working phone. I have initiated a return of the phone; there was no reason for return in the drop-down menu that truly applies to why. I chose ""No longer needed"", as that was the one closest to why I was returning the item. I think that Amazon should bear some responsibility for selling refurbished, unlocked phones. It appears that ""unlocked"" status does not guarantee that it will remain unlocked, as was my case. Previous owner may still report to service provider that phone was lost or stolen, in which case the service provider locks the phone.","R6H5LQ0EHQUCL",,,,,,,,"2","Delivered Unlocked but later on got Locked","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R6H5LQ0EHQUCL","Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2024","5662","148",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: (Product) Red, Size: 128GB","B0BN72FYFG","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","(Product) Red","Size","128GB"

Contacted the seller they said I could choose 1 of 3 things… partial refund ($25) and keep the phone. Refund & send back. Or return & replacement. I chose the $25 & keep because it was small things & it would be a hassle to send it back & replace it. A couple days go by & I start making phone calls. Other caller says they can’t hear me. I’m muffled or cutting out. 3 or 4 people have now said they can’t hear me on this “excellent” condition phone. So now I’m having to contact them and/or fork out $70+ to fix the speaker issue. Just do yourself a favor and spend the extra and buy it new. Also a $25 refund on the $300+ phone compares to a .10 raise at your job, in my opinion.

I called apple service too, but they were also surprised to our situation. Eventually my daughter still can’t use her mail app. Also the battery was 81% when I received, is it called excellent?

Locking the phone doesn’t help them get their money, it just tries to discourage secondhand purchase. Their offer was for us to purchase another phone through them.

I was a refurbished iPhone 14. It came in a nice box and a charger cable, but not a charger. Not usually a problem as most people over time accumulate several them over time. It looked brand new and works fine. Unfortunately, I had assumed that refurbished meant “like new”, but apparently it also means “it was checked out, cleaned up and it works”. What it does not mean is a new battery. Mine had a battery with 84% charge capacity. In fairness, the company’s fine print indicates this so that’s on me to have overlooked that. In fairness I did get a “newer” phone just not one that was “like new” which meant like a new one, not just close. So, the iPhone is a newer one and works well, just will not hold a charge as long.

It would be fine for days to a week or so, but then would shut its self off randomly despite how much charge the phone had. Then would turn its self on, & repeat this process until the battery completely died & got very hot. This happened about 3 times before I was able to actually initiate the return. Even though I had to return the phone, I’m leaving 4 stars because customer service was great. I was able to get a complete refund very easily. They made the return process very quick & smooth & was issued a full refund as soon as they received the phone in the mail. I purchased from this seller in the past, & would still use this seller again. This phone came in almost brand new condition. There was one super small 2 mm scratch on the screen, but it is not deep, barely noticeable & does not affect function. Cameras are great, battery life came at 99%, holds a charge very well!! Overall great phone, & got here quick. It did not come with an Apple charger, but the listing says that it does not. This is not a big deal to me at all, as I have a bunch laying around. This is the second time I’ve bought a phone off Amazon & I have not been disappointed either time (the last one lasted 6 years & I just upgraded to this iphone).","R3VBPPJZKP8O53",,,,,,,,"33","Defective item, great customer service, easy return.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3VBPPJZKP8O53","Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2023","5662","197",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Purple, Size: 256GB","B0BN72FYFG","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Purple","Size","256GB"

It came in two days early and I was surprised to see it looked brand new with no scratches and bumps anywhere that I could see. The phone itself worked perfectly and came in at a nice 96% battery life so it’s not perfect but it’s up there. The box and accessories were kinda cheap and not so great but I was upgrading from my old iPhone SE so I had spares around. Overall as of I'm writing this, this phone works perfectly fine and almost brand new, the price wasn’t the best but it was certainly cheaper than a brand new one. The only gripes I have is the phone came in kind of full of smudges from a wipe and it was a pain to set up the eSIM but it’s not too bad and just takes some effort. I would highly recommend buying this iPhone from this seller and I am probably gonna buy from here again when I need to upgrade but honestly I’m quite happy with my purchase.","R3MX4J7M2KV08U",,,,,,,,"22","Almost brand new","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3MX4J7M2KV08U","Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024","5662","197",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: (Product) Red, Size: 128GB","B0BN72FYFG","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","(Product) Red","Size","128GB"
