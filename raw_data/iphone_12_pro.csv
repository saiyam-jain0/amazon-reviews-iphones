While they go above and beyond in the marketing of the device “factory re-manufactured” and “certified pre-owned” and ETC are all fancy wording for SECOND HAND, and USED. That said, with high hopes I purchased this device in May 2024 for my birthday, everything seemed to work fine, even though I noticed that the Maximum Battery Capacity was below 90%. —- Now in late January 2025 roughly only 8 months of use and the MBC has fallen to 77%, which has shown extreme degradation in that it cannot hold a charge. In addition, I have noticed that the touch screen is intermittent-Meaning that sometimes it works, and sometimes it does not. Sometimes no have to press multiple times and extremely firm—Note that all softer is up to day on the iOS, as well as the Apps used. Also note that I have equipped this phone with a highend sturdy case, which has kept it well protected, although it has not suffered any falls or drops of any kind. Additionally, the screen is and has been protected and covered since the day I received the phone and it still intact with NO cracks or scratches —- All that said, aside from the disappointment of the battery not being at 99% when received and now not holding a charge through the day even with a mid day recharge, I am surprised that I could not get to at least a full 2 years before minor or even major hardware degradation had set in. The question then lies with the company who is selling the phones vs the Apple product itself. I can say ALL my Apple iPhone devices have held the test of time and I’ve never had to upgrade due to hardware, but due to obsoletion. SO, it is my assessment that the company selling the second hand item needs to do a better job checking the devices before resale, as well as fairly pricing it for its age and prior use.-not to mention changing the battery component if it is below 90%. The one, and only good thing I can say was the phone appeared relatively new with little evidence of use meaning just monor scratches on the metal chassis housing, although this goes completely unnoticed as the phone is covered completely with protection. The status of the companies integrity is still up for debate, if they can accommodate my request for a replacement to a newer iPhone model, for which I will pay the difference I will then say happy shopping to all customers, if not, I will say be WEARY of buying used, older model iPhone devices by smaller relatively unknown companies.","R2SSJ1514HS7NQ","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/712txFhjfQL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,"56","Touch screen intermittent; battery does not hold charge","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2SSJ1514HS7NQ","Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2025","12411","850",,,"Size: 256GB, Color: Graphite, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PMYLKVF","Size","256GB","Color","Graphite","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

I thought by buying refurbished from AMZN, a trusted source, I would be OK. Wrong. Within a few weeks of using it the screen started acting funny. Not fully malfunctioning, just small things: a swipe here and there wouldn't work, the top of the screen would occasionally not respond to touch/swipe, a spontaneous video call when typing a Whatsapp message (embarrassing!). The small snafus gradually got bad enough that I called AMZN support and asked them what my options were. The answer: none unless you act almost immediately after purchase (when it of course was still working great). Finally, I took into the Apple store to get a replacement screen for $279 after I grew tired of constantly working around the malfunctions. To my great surprise, Apple wouldn't repair it b/c the phone had an indicator that water had been inside. Once that happens, they won't touch it if it's out of warranty (which it is when you buy refurbished). Mind you, iPhone 12 is rated “IP68,” which means it's fully protected from dust and is water resistant for up to 30 minutes at a depth of 6 meters. I never dropped my phone in the water, not once. Which means AMZN sold me a lemon and I just didn't realize it until too late. Apple will credit me only $100 for trade-in value, so $400+ is up in smoke after about a year of use. Be warned!! There is no recourse for refurbished phone buyers. Caveat emptor.

Was placed on a call to Apple Care by Amazon, and was told that my phone is defective and needed to be returned to shop or store it was bought from. This is where the ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE from these people comes in at: After conversing with them over how to return this phone, I was given instructions that are unworkable via the Amazon website, (and was told to call Amazon, which I am glad I did in the end). After I told this vender to return my trade-in and was seeking a full refund, all communication from their side abruptly stopped. They never sent me the required paid return label and authorization number to send this defective phone back to them. This resulted in an A to Z Amazon guarantee claim against this third party vendor for their inaction. Lesson learned for me here, is deal only with Amazon proper and no third party sellers. This seller is only interested in the sale. If your purchased phone is not defective, everything is great with this seller. But if your phone is defective, just expect to fight for your refund and pray that you get your old trade-in phone back. Update: Amazon A to Z guarantee finally did give me an authorization and paid return label to send the defective phone back, and refunded me the cost of the purchased phone plus my trade-in phone that got lost. This whole process took four weeks to resolve.","R3TODSRSO29G53",,,,,,,,,,,,,"29","Customer Service Is ZERO From This Third Party Vender","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3TODSRSO29G53","Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2023","12411","850",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Graphite, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PMYLKVF","Size","128GB","Color","Graphite","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

On the pro max it was deep scratches and on this 12 pro a massive crack pictured above. I ordered a renewed excellent condition iPhone 12 Pro Max. When getting ready to apply a screen protector I noticed the top right corner of the screen was cracked. On closer inspection I found it was a screen protector, but when I removed it I found there was a thick adhesive type layer that fills in the gaps on numerous scratches of the actual screen so you can’t see them. At first I thought no big deal - great reviews so must be a one time weird thing and didn’t like the size of the pro max anyways, so I bought this excellent condition iPhone 12 Pro. Same thing this time, but worse. Rather than deep screen scratches, there’s a massive crack running the length of the screen underneath the screen protector. This wouldn’t be visible without removing the screen protector that comes on it but regardless, two iPhone 12’s in a row through renewed (not renewed premium) have hided the fact that these are not excellent condition in the slightest. And rather than replacing the screen, the seller has covered up the damage in the cheapest way possible. Lots of good reviews for these, so I imagine not all are as bad as mine. But, considering this happened back to back, it isn’t a coincidence and I’m sure others have been scammed by this as well. So please make sure to inspect the phone very closely upon delivery so you can return it if this is the case.

Not sure why this process takes forever given that it was a faulty, misrepresented product in the first place. My first experience buying a refurbished phone was not a good one and I won't make the same mistake again.","RN248DK28LFRI",,,,,,,,,,,,,"10","Would've been a great phone had it worked.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RN248DK28LFRI","Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2024","12411","850",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Pacific Blue, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PMYLKVF","Size","128GB","Color","Pacific Blue","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

While the phone looks good cosmetically, several issues fall well below that standard. The battery health is only at 82%, which is quite low for a phone advertised as “excellent.” The signal quality is poor during calls, even in areas where I normally have strong reception. The touchscreen has stopped responding in certain areas, making the device difficult to use properly. To make matters worse, although the phone is covered by ASURION, they charge a service fee of $49 plus taxes (a total of $51.94) for repairs — even though the issues were present right out of the box. That’s incredibly frustrating. The phone technically works, but it’s far from flawless and definitely not what was promised. Very disappointed with both the product and the support process.","R2WKF0J0YE89S2",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Do not buy - read my review!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WKF0J0YE89S2","Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2025","12411","850",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Pacific Blue, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PMYLKVF","Size","128GB","Color","Pacific Blue","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

Arrived the next day, but went to set it up and it was Locked to a carrier, when it said fully unlocked. Brought it to my carrier, but there was nothing they could do. Chatted with Amazon customer service and she said she could give me a discount and I could get it unlocked locally at an Apple Store. Drove to Apple store and the girl said there was nothing they could do. So, basically a waste of my day. The only option was to return it and now I have to wait for the funds to be returned back into my gift card, which said could take up to 30 days. I’m nervous to get another renewed phone, but I did have a good experience with the last one. Only thing, not the phone is not as great of a deal and $100 more. I am very disappointed in this experience.","R204WJ9DTG2XZ7",,,,,,,,,,,,,"2","Phone was locked","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R204WJ9DTG2XZ7","Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2024","12411","850",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Graphite, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PMYLKVF","Size","128GB","Color","Graphite","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

The sound is all fuzzy and you can barely hear when someone calls even if it is on speaker. I was borrowing a phone until I receive this one and no longer have a spare phone to use. Customer Service said the only option is to start a full refund which means I will not have the money back until they receive the phone back… I am a single mother with three kids. I cannot go without a phone for days. I also use the phone for my full-time job.

The phone arrived in a cheap, generic ""Smart Device"" box from Kiss Electronics, and apart from a lightly scratched screen and some surface wear it appeared fine at first glance. However, the real problem came when I tried to use the phone to make calls. The right microphone doesn't work, which means that nobody could hear me on phone calls (although I could hear them). This defeats the whole purpose of a phone I took it to the Apple service center who told me that fixing this problem would require the replacement of the complete Rear System which is a major repair.

But no, it wasn't. Generally speaking, the iphone works fine (I've had it for 4 days, tough). Today I had to make a phone call and I just realized that it's not working. I can only talk and hear through the speaker option. I can't have a normal phone conversation without everyone hears it. That sucks! I contacted Amazon and the only option they gave me was to return and refund, which wouldn't be a problem if I wasn't in Peru (only UPS pick ups!). So, I'm kinda stuck with an iphone that doesn't work completely. Good luck I bought the Premium one, huh... The box comes with several information about the iphone you just bought and how an amazing world citizen you are for buying a refurbished item. One card is a 20-Point Inspection - Test Certificate, which has a checklist of the things they've checked before you luckily buy it.

While the reaction states you’ll get more than 80% but it was exactly at 80%. The battery would drain so fast it wasn’t a ‘mobile’ phone. I was weary of the negative comments but was hopeful as people who had good experience really did get a top notch phone with no body damage and 100% batter.

The phone is refurbished and is supposed to be in perfect working order but there are many issues. The touch screen is often unresponsive. There is an issue with the MagSafe and a diagnostic recommends “rear systems repair” also the ear piece doesn’t work so you have to take calls with Bluetooth or speaker phone. The Apple geniuses also suspected the phone had been repaired with non-apple parts and has signs of water damage. THE WORST PART is that there are no replacement or exchange options. I will only be refunded once I send the phone in and I was told it could take up to 30 DAYS to get my refund. So I’m either stuck with a junk phone or have to go a month without a phone.

In this case, the exterior was wonderful, clean, and everything appeared to be ready to go but the battery was dead. Plugging into a multitude of chargers, charging cords (including the used cord provided) yielded absolutely nothing. After hours of being connected (see video) in the hopes that the Apple iBrick 12 Pro would eventually charge –– nothing. ""Renewed"" evidently means the iOS was reset and the exterior wiped with a clean cloth. In less than the one-day turnaround for return, I stumbled upon the reviews of the DNCL-Techzone.

Waste of time and terrible seller - clearly trying to make money restocking garbage phones.","R3G1SONY0XQN5V",,,,,,,,,,,,,"4","Buy phones from someone else","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3G1SONY0XQN5V","Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2023","12411","850",,,"Size: 512GB, Color: Graphite, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PMYLKVF","Size","512GB","Color","Graphite","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

Looks brand new. Got all info transferred and set up without issues. All the sudden screen went black. Took hours for it to come back on. Today, 6/3/23 it was stuck on black screen most of day. I would think they would put it through heavy testing before recertification or refurbishing. This isn’t good because I cannot check my blood sugar. Ithrough my the app. Not at all happy. Today is June 16th. Phone continues to black out. It does eventually come back on. Not sure what to do. I need a phone even if it’s working half the time. I could exchange or get a refund but I would have to reset and then I would be without a phone. This is so frustrating!. So is not August 12th. My phone went. black for good. I should have called it in as defective but I wanted to prove that this phone was defective. No doubt that it was a problem with the OS system. If I kept the phone constantly on it would not go black. But it could never be locked or go to sleep. This was a pain because I had to be careful not to call someone by mistake. Now that my over $500 iPhone 12 Pro has died and gone to heaven I will NEVER buy another refurbished phone unless it is from APPLE because they will back their products. I think this would have done better if from Amazon but I did not want to deal with a third party and go through the hassle of trying to get my phone back on so I could factory reset it before being sent back. There would have been no way would send my phone back and it was signed into my iCloud and someone would have access to all that information. So I lost over $500 dollars because I could not reset my phone to send back.

Buying an Amazon-refurbished iPhone 12 Pro was a big mistake. Just 3 months later, my phone blacks out, I mean the screen turns off while I’m using it and it’s very difficult to turn the screen back on. I literally have to wait until it’s ready to do it on its own. And yes, all my updates are current. Btw, I bought one in gold and another in pacific blue and they both have similar issues. My advice, purchase direct from the Apple Store and save yourself the headache and additional expense. Initial review: Firstly, the phone arrived ahead of schedule. Outward appearance, 10/10 as there were no scratches or distinctive markings on the phone. Upon testing the phone, which I initially thought worked perfectly, I realized that there was no audio coming from the ear speaker/receiver. I reported the issue to my seller, MOBILESUPPLY, who admittingly was very quick with their responses and were willing to assist with a return or a refund. Luckily, we were able to run a complete diagnostic with Apple who in the end fixed the speaker issue, which required me leaving the phone at the store for a few hours. Overall, the product was well kept, although I strongly suggest MOBILESUPPLY retest ALL aspects of the phone's performances before selling it to customers. This could have easily cost me additional funds, or I would have to go through the hassle of returning the item as I live outside of the US and was only there for 3 days. :(","R1SXLFJ4NHSQAY",,,,,,,,,,,,,"2","Almost too good to be true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1SXLFJ4NHSQAY","Reviewed in the United States on September 19, 2023","12411","272",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Pacific Blue, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PMYLKVF","Size","128GB","Color","Pacific Blue","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

We're all very busy and she works as well as goes to school and is always on the move. So we thought quickest thing to do, was to get a phone on Amazon, we received it in a very timely fashion thanks to my Amazon Prime level of service. But since we've gotten it, the battery has been draining very quickly. At times constraints have left us trapped with this phone for now having to carry a charger with it at all times and it sometimes running out before reaching certain destinations. The seller refunded at least $25 out of the nearly $400 then we were charged for this phone. And all they could say is that it's a refurbished phone that we should expect these things. But even a used car will have newer tires on it before reselling, so they should have put a new battery in it at least.

The warranties and guarantee of 90+ made the Premium Renewed a great choice. The first phone was near perfect except it arrived at 89% on the battery. So why not try again and exchange it for another one. Well no exchanges are offered. So I was told to buy another one and send the first one back for a refunded. The second phone arrived with several nicks around the face plate but it was 91%. I decided to live with the first phone and send the damaged one back. It’s now been 3 weeks since it arrived back at Amazon with no acknowledgement of receiving it. All I have is the tracking number showing a delivery. After several attempts to get the refund back I still have no indication that it’s coming soon. So much for the statements in the description that you can return the phone with no issues for up to a year. Next time I’ll just go to the Apple website and buy it there.

It could not connect to any internet networks. I somehow got it to work after an hour of troubleshooting only for it to go back to its defective state after about 3 hours of internet connection. I researched this problem and found out many other people are having this problem with their iPhone (12/12 Pro/12 Pro Max). My problem with the seller is that they probably didn't check for this issue before sending me this phone.

Then after some days, I noticed some problem with the Bluetooth connectivity and the Face ID feature. Bluetooth connectivity issue was on and off. I ignored it. Then, within a month or two, the display started having issues. The brightness of the phone is gone now completely. It is all dark even after setting the brightness to the highest level. Can’t use the phone in bright sunny day ofcourse. Then, I realized that is why the Face ID feature was not working properly. I waited to request the return because I was on vacation and out of country. Otherwise, I would’ve initiated the return within a month. I bought it, thinking of the environment and cheaper price.

The battery loses total power in less than a day while in idle mode with wifi and data off. This was an issue I accepted to rectify because of the hassle and cost of international returns. The deal breaker for me was the fact that phone is crippled with regards to bluetooth function. After several factory, network and DFU resets the bluetooth still fails to function. It is not recognizable to or from any other of the multiple functioning devices when checked. At this point i just have to accept loss or pay the high rates to return the item as there's little or no help catering for international buyers who are face with similar problems. It a case of weighing out your return cost vs cost of actual. I humbly suggest again to anyone outside US who is considering renewed products . Save up!

The phone is worth it, so I will get it replaced when I can. Phone works as it should and updated to iOS 18.5 with no issues. Seller shipped very quickly and it was received priority next day, so it came before noon. Pretty happy overall. Phone was also unlocked as advertised. I ordered the phone in graphite. It looks pretty good and has a heaviness to it that makes it feel premium. It feels sturdy and well-built. The screen was protected during shipping along with the back cameras, which is nice. The phone was protected overall during shipping and came with a charging cord and adapter (both off-brand), but work nonetheless. Will definitely get a new battery, but the phone looks great with no scratches on the back and just the very minor ones (can be hidden with case and screen protector).

The phone works flawlessly and offers all the high-performance features I need without the hefty price tag of a brand new device. For anyone who doesn't require the latest and greatest technology but still wants a quality smartphone experience, going with a renewed option is a smart choice. The phone arrived in excellent condition, with no noticeable signs of previous use, and the battery life has been impressive. I've saved a substantial amount of money by choosing this option, and I strongly recommend considering Amazon's renewed phones for anyone looking for a great deal on a reliable device.","RL8JB8T7CG0I7",,,,,,,,,,,,,"2","Excellent Value for Money","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RL8JB8T7CG0I7","Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2025","12411","457",,,"Size: 256GB, Color: Pacific Blue, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PMYLKVF","Size","256GB","Color","Pacific Blue","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

My IPhone 7+ finally gave up the ghost. I was hoping to get through the remainder of this year so that when the IPhone 15 came out that I would get a renewed 14 Max Pro but that was not to be. We had purchased a renewed IPhone 12 for my son from another seller and were surprised with how clean it was when it arrived. We paid extra for the excellent condition and it was in pristine condition with a 100% battery max battery health. Prime day comes along and I see this phone from this seller. It was roughly $200 more than the regular IPhone 12 that we bought for my son but it was the Pro model and it did have 512k of storage. Due to the positive experience we had with the earlier purchase, I decided to pull the trigger. Fulfillment was great. I had ordered the phone on 7/11 and it was scheduled to arrive on 7/14 but to my surprise it hit my house on 7/13 which was a nice surprise. When I picked up the package I got worried because I could hear and feel something rattling in the box that was shipped in a form fitting padded envelope. To my relief I found the phone to be intact. It arrived with protective plastic on the screen, a SIM port tool, and a lightning charging cable that was loose in the box. Upon inspection I found the screen to be free of scratches or gouges but there is some slight surface marring on a small section of the screen that you have to look for in order to see. The bezel was clean except for a couple of nicks. The worst sign of usage is a chip above the top of the highest camera lens. It’s not huge but you can definitely see it and it looks like a chip in a car windshield since the back of the phone is finished in glass. The only other thing to mention is that there was a bit of what looks like green metal tape that was poking out of the side of the phone between the screen and bezel which I was able to rub off with my fingernail. It looked like the refurb process was not as clean as it could have been. Going into the settings I found that the max battery life was only 85% which was kind of a bummer. Setting up the phone was a breeze with ICloud but I haven’t figured out how to pull down the pictures that resided on my old phone. My apps came over but know I had to re-enter my passwords in most cases. After only a couple of day usage, everything seems to work fine. Amazon gives 90 days to return for any issues. The camera on the pro is a definite improvement over the 7+. Size wise the unit is smaller than the 7+ but the screen is bigger on the 12 since it doesn’t have the home button at the bottom which I keep wanting to press out of habit. Overall the purchase was better than ok. If the phone has another 10% of battery life and the nick on the camera was not present then I would rate the item as excellent. I’ll always wonder if I should have purchased a phone from the other seller that sold a phone in perfect condition. I will update this review should anything major happen with the phone.","R1AQ90UQMZLWVV",,,,,,,,,,,,,"136","Nice Phone","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1AQ90UQMZLWVV","Reviewed in the United States on July 16, 2023","12411","457",,,"Size: 512GB, Color: Graphite, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PMYLKVF","Size","512GB","Color","Graphite","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

The brand was “HybridIT”. Just got the phone today, and it’s working great and as expected so far, but do I have a few concerns. My biggest concern is with the packaging. The phone was simply placed inside the cardboard insert with no foam sleeve or protection (as shown in 1st picture). You can see there’s about a 1/2 inch of wiggle room with nothing holding it in place, meaning it was very likely sliding around the cardboard during transit. Luckily I didn’t notice any major damage or scratches. Another smaller concern is that the phone was visibly not thoroughly cleaned. The smudges and marks easily came off, but you can see some grime along the side edges (refer to pictures). I was hoping for a higher standard of cleanliness with Amazon’s highest option. Otherwise, the phone does work great and feels almost brand new. I’ve tested all the features with no problems and was pleasantly surprised to see the battery health was at 94%, which is really good considering phones generally degrade to around 90-80% (depending on use) after a year or two.

I had difficulty hearing when I received or tried to call someone using the phone. I did . contact customer support. They sent a link for me to contact Apple as they were the manufacture. Apple did set me up with an appointment to have it checked out. They did fix the sound issue but also told me I had faulty microphone.. so evidently everything is not exactly checked out to make it like new when you buy a renewed phone. This was the second 12 Pro that I bought through Amazon Amazon. The first one I sent right back.. On that note, I do like the phone. I think I will try out my phone for a bit to see if I have any more issues before I see if I need to send it back , it does have a warranty . I did buy an OtterBox case for it which I like really well.. I hope this helps anyone that is looking for a phone.","R2R03UA6RYBCMO",,,,,,,,,,,,,"3","iPhone 12 Pro","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2R03UA6RYBCMO","Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2024","12411","457",,,"Size: 256GB, Color: Pacific Blue, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed Premium","B08PMYLKVF","Size","256GB","Color","Pacific Blue","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed Premium"

It's got all the external features you could really need, and it's super clean and efficient, which is my favorite thing about iPhones. It was way too expensive, even refurbished, but it functions well, so I'd say it was worth it. It holds a charge relatively well, though you have to be careful not to keep too many apps running at once. I love the squared edge design, and it came in mint condition. You would never know that it was refurbished. The only problems I've had so far are with the cameras, though I think that was my fault, and just the software options, which have nothing to do with the phone itself.

I like how the phone came with a brand new installed glass protector that looks flawless and multiple SIM card tray keys which comes in handy. It’s expected for a refurbished product to have some flaws but this phone has extremely minor and very minuscule flaws such as some very almost unnoticeable scratches around the edges of the phone unless you really look and give close up and sharp eye examination but they’re so minor and the phone is going to have a case eventually anyway. I’m not going to hold the non Apple boxing against the seller and product because again this is a refurbished product and not brand new and I’m overall very happy with the quality of what I received and I did like the kind of box it came in. Along with the phone is a charging cord and wall adapter that’s not by Apple and is by a company called Ashley. I’m honestly not that worried about the off brand charger but it was thoughtful to provide. I did turn on the phone and everything worked and looked great but I didn’t test the sound. I’ll update on the sound quality when my boyfriend opens it for Christmas.","R3OTHAAIDFNMWA","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+GKjN0uTL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6138U8levyL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61n26UhBR3L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61xXualFNYL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71H9GgEeTbL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71UDLi46rZL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71UbCuMRoGL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71cDa54VZPL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gLacowQXL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71nhdLLLXRL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71rIeHPwpjL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71vr+9j++VL._SY88.jpg","33","Great Quality for Refurbished","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OTHAAIDFNMWA","Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2023","12411","457",,,"Size: 256GB, Color: Silver, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PMYLKVF","Size","256GB","Color","Silver","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

Everything was great until I made a phone call and tried to use the device like a phone! The blasted thing came with a blown speaker! That’s why it was marked down! The speaker sounds terrible and you can’t very well hear what the person on the other end is even saying.

I received it within 2 days of ordering which was great! It appeared in excellent physical condition: no scratches on the screen or back, just a few scruffs on the corners. The device worked as it should except when I tried to use the rear facing camera, I noticed the picture was very blurry. I contacted Amazon and they walked me through a series of steps to attempt to fix the issue. When that didn’t work, they contacted the seller directly and expressed my concerns. The seller said I could return the phone and if they had a replacement in stock they’d exchange the device, but if it was out of stock I’d get a refund. I asked if they could send a replacement before I sent the phone back since I didn’t have another phone to use, but the seller was adamant that they receive the device before sending a replacement. So I sent the defective phone back and waited a week before I heard anything. I was then informed that I’d be receiving a refund. If I would’ve known that I’d be getting a refund, I would’ve bought a new phone once I knew this one was defective. I appreciate that this seller stands by their product and made the situation right, but it was a great inconvenience to me as a buyer not having a phone for 7 days.

My recent experience with a supposedly ""certified"" refurbished unit from a third-party seller has been nothing short of disappointing. Let's start with the voice quality. Despite being touted as ""like new,"" the voice quality during calls is abysmal. Voices sound muffled, and there's a constant static noise that makes conversations a struggle. In an age where crystal-clear audio is expected, this issue is simply unacceptable. But the problems don't stop there. The battery life on this refurbished unit is a joke. After a mere few hours of moderate use, the battery drains alarmingly fast, leaving you tethered to a power source. And to make matters worse, the battery health has already depleted to a dismal 88% – a far cry from the promised ""like new"" condition. Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of this purchase is the lack of warranty coverage. Since the Apple warranty has expired, any issues that arise will be solely the responsibility of the new owner. That means costly repairs or replacement expenses down the line, effectively negating any potential savings from buying a refurbished device. In conclusion, while the allure of a discounted refurbished iPhone 12 Pro is understandable, this particular unit fails to deliver on its promises. Poor voice quality, abysmal battery life, and the lack of warranty protection make this a purchase I cannot recommend. Unless you're willing to take a significant gamble, it's best to steer clear of this particular offering and explore alternative options.","R2TZQSAXQMWUE5",,,,,,,,,,,,,"24","Beware of what's under the hood","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2TZQSAXQMWUE5","Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2024","12411","320",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Graphite, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PMYLKVF","Size","128GB","Color","Graphite","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"
