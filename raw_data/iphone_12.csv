Around 2 months I bought this refurbished phone. I have always bought refurbished phones or used family members old phones and have never had one last less than a year. This is my first time buying from Amazon and not another website specific to refurbished phones. As of today, this phone is no longer usable . Within one month, the battery life on this phone decreased where I would need to charge when I got home from work (I do not use my phone in my job). This was strange because the battery capacity was listed at 90%. I have had batteries not be as effective of refurbished phones before, but never like this. There also appears to be a spot on the phone where the screen is slightly uneven, despite no drops or other exposures. Again, I have never had this issue before. Within the past two weeks, the phone will randomly drop from 90% to 1% within a span of 20 minutes (not always, just sometimes and often when not in use) and will die. The volume randomly gets loud and quiet and the face id stopped working. Again, these are all issues I have never experienced with any phone I have had. As of today, the phone died (while I was working, after not being picked up even once from 8 AM to 3 PM) and is stuck trying to restart (turning on and off with the white apple logo). Eventually a screen telling me to plug it into restore it appeared, but it will still not restore. My co-worker is convinced it's not even a legit iPhone, though I don't even know if this is true. The seller for my phone is listed as All About Apple and has thus far not been helpful. I do not plan on buying a refurbished phone again from Amazon based on my experience with this seller.","R122LNX4NP7Y47",,,,,,,,,,"8","Defective Phone","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R122LNX4NP7Y47","Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2025","31456","2375",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: White, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PP5MSVB","Size","128GB","Color","White","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

I understood that renewed was no indication of perfect but that it was in excellent condition and that it was diagnostically tested. However upon receiving the product and without much use, I realize that it was overheating. I contacted the SYNERGY about this issue and they said I should return which is reasonable on their part. However, this was not reasonable for me, I am an international customer and as such I had to pay over $200 dollars in additional shipping and handling. I communicated the financial disadvantages to SYNERGY and suggest that it would be more economically viable to fix the phone locally and then they could refund me the cost of the repairs. They insisted that I should return but with further insistence they offered me a $25 refund, which would not cover the Technician's fees. By this time, the phone was now not charging all together. I took me about 3 hours before I could get it back to remove my data and reset the phone. I did my research and I was able to get DHL to attempt return the product. New problem is, they were unable to deliver to SYNERGY because their location was closed on a Monday at 12:52 pm and no one sees it fit to respond to my request. I am urging Amazon to look into this matter ASAP. A phone that I bought for $310 is now costing me upwards of $800 and I still don't have a phone to use.","R28O9Q3UDC7NRY",,,,,,,,,,"12","POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND DEFECTIVE PHONE WITHOUT ANY RECOURSE","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28O9Q3UDC7NRY","Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2025","31456","2375",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Black, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PP5MSVB","Size","128GB","Color","Black","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

I was excited to be getting a new phone for the first time in a few years. I was upset upon first even receiving the package, because I could feel the phone loose with other items in the package. It was packed loosely in a zip-loc bag with a bubble wrap pocket, and too much room in the box. There was, loose, a charger and sim tool, which the sim tool had ripped the small plastic sleeve it was in and arrived loose in the box. The camera upon inspection has a scratch in the lens going right over the center of the camera. The other camera has gouges around the lens. Around the edges of the phone, it appears to have been dropped multiple times, with gouges out of the corners, not just scratches. There is also a spot on the back where the glass appears to have been chemically etched by a spill of some sort. The spot around the cameras upon arrival was filthy and covered in what appeared to be grime left behind from the previous owners case, since this is a refurbished, “Renewed” phone. There side walls of the phone are flecked with spots of missing paint as if it came into contact with some kind of acetone or paint thinner, which would explain the etched spill mark on the back glass. The protective screen around the microphone also was missing from one of three holes on the bottom, meaning dirt, grime, dust, etc. can all freely blow into the phone. There are also minor scratch marks in and around the charging port, and the charger feels loose inside the port as well. For a refurbished product listed as “Good” quality, I am highly disappointed, as this is not just cosmetic damage. I haven’t even set it up yet, as I will most likely be returning it.","R7LFJFRSF4TVN","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Aqf2ePsAL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61syGfzCqML._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61y9wmZ5LwL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71AVbB38BwL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,"9","Not what I expected for “Good” quality.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7LFJFRSF4TVN","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024","31456","2375",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Blue, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PP5MSVB","Size","128GB","Color","Blue","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

How excited I was to purchase a refurbished iphone promised to be fully functional and the only difference from new being battery life capacity is at 80% instead of 100% - to be expected, and fine. The warranty for this purchase if 3 months or 90 days. Months 1-3, it works fine. 4, 5, battery draining more quickly - doesn't last through the whole day, but I remind myself this is a refurbished phone so it's not perfect. At the start of month 6 - my phone randomly can no longer do Face ID to open the phone. When you try to fix it in Settings, ""Face ID not available at this time"" - is all you get. Then, the right side of the touch screen stops working. Try texting or messaging without m or n or , or ; or p or o. I was out of town so had to delay getting to the apple store to fix it - and week 2, the left side of the touch screen stops working. I had to change my passcode to numbers in the middle of the keypad cuz face ID is gone and the keys on the right and left won't work. When I message and email Amazon and the manufacturer - both are EXTREMELY unhelpful - ""The 90 day warranty has passed so there is nothing we can do"" from the manufacturer and Amazon when this is an Amazon Renewed product. The warranty is at 3 months because the phone starts to melt at 4 months and craps out on you at 6 months. DON'T BUY IT. After returning from the Genius Bar at the Apple store, they told me it would cost $450 (I bought the phone for $453) to fix the touch screen and the face ID - and they were happy to tell me to buy the iphone 13 or 14. If you want to buy refurbished, buy direct from the Apple store - don't buy on Amazon and don't buy Amazon renewed or from this manufacturer. Don't buy this product. UTTERLY disappointing. And now I have to buy a new phone 6 months after buying a new phone.","R3Q6Q1M5CGSYF",,,,,,,,,,"72","DON'T BUY THIS, FAM! 3-MONTH WARRANTY ON PURPOSE BECAUSE THE PHONE MELTS DOWN AT 6 MONTHS.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3Q6Q1M5CGSYF","Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2023","31456","2375",,,"Size: 64GB, Color: Black, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PP5MSVB","Size","64GB","Color","Black","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

Specifically ordered an “excellent” condition phone to get the best possible quality but apparently that doesn’t change anything. First of all, phone came damaged with a large impact to the bezel clear as day seen in pictures. That however is the least of my worries. Placed the phone on the charger & charged to 100% before removing from charger so as to not overcharge. Left phone unused overnight with 0 running apps, 0 screen time, roaming off, & no background apps of any sort. Woke up 5 hours later to a 50% battery. Phone was not updating, was not syncing iCloud, nor was anything else running during this 5 hours at all. After waking up I checked the Time on my screen 3 times (that’s it)…..47%……SERIOUSLY?! Made my 1.5 hr drive into work without touching the phone once not even to check the time (again absolutely 0 programs or apps running in background)…..35%?!?! I can only imagine that if I had been actively receiving calls/texts & checking social media once in a while that this battery would last maybe 2 hours at best. It’s clear to me that they must be using fraudulent parts/batteries as battery health score rates at a 91% in phone settings which makes no sense. With a battery like this you are better off buying a corded house phone…I will be giving the seller one opportunity to correct this before taking further action. All evidence posted in pictures of screen time proof & battery degradation.

Long version: Phone gets delivered. Yay new phone. In great condition. Move all my information to new phone. Thank god I didn’t remove everything from old phone. Proceed to switch over phone with carrier and the new phone is still on the previous owners service. So sit on the phone for 2 hours to find out that I have to return it. So, erase all the data I just switched to the phone. Figure out on returning the case and everything I bought to go with the phone(is it even worth doing). Huge hassle. They tell me on the phone that this can happen since it’s an Amazon renewed. Had they said in the description the phone may be on the previous carrier and you won’t be able to use it, I think a lot of people wouldn’t take the chance buying it. So now I got money sitting out there waiting for ups to pick it up and then could take 2 weeks to get to Amazon. Asked for a recording of the convo we had. She said yes. Put on hold then asked why do I need it and then said she will not send it. No compensation, nothing for wasting my time and holding onto my money. (Not $20) Just a really all around bad time for me with nothing in return but a bad taste in my mouth and not even wanting to be an Amazon sheep anymore.","R2VWWLXJJ8UZX3",,,,,,,,,,"29","Read before purchasing!!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VWWLXJJ8UZX3","Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2024","31456","2375",,,"Size: 64GB, Color: White, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed Premium","B08PP5MSVB","Size","64GB","Color","White","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed Premium"

Unfortunately I dropped the phone and cracked the back of it. Of course, the seller did not accept the return and I don’t blame them, however I am going to give this product a bad review b/c it had a defective battery in this refurbished product from the beginning.

Was impressed at how clean the phone looked and the professional packaging. After setting up the phone I noticed on my first phone call that the speaker had an unusual rattle. The rattle was confirmed and more noticeable while playing music and videos. Not impressed that a phone that supposedly passed a ""20 point inspection"" was allowed to ship with a noticeable rattle from the speaker. Sure the speakers worked but the sound was distorted which was irritating and unexpected. After calling Amazon support to promptly report the issue, the support staff were incredibly understanding and tried to come up with a solution. But, this is my first new phone in 4 years (my previous phone being a refurbished Android bought from Amazon) and I had upgraded after prompting from my carrier to upgrade due to network changes so I can not just reactivate my old phone in the interim. The only recourse the staff could offer was a refund after returning, not even a replacement after I indicated I liked the phone besides the speaker issue. So to end up with the same iphone I have to ship this phone back, wait for a refund, and then reorder the phone from Amazon! Mind you I would also have to either work without a phone (which isn't an option thanks to two step authentication) or go buy a different phone in the interim that I could receive sooner. I am extremely disappointed in Amazon's ability and willingness to support students and the lack of options the support staff were able to offer despite their best efforts. If you are looking for a phone that might ""look"" great but will probably have a noticeable defect then this is the option for you but don't bother trying to receive adequate assistance from Amazon, especially if you are a student because they will leave you high and dry without any satisfactory options.","R15MZKO08EB873",,,,,,,,,,"20","Amazon Cares Little About Supporting Students","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15MZKO08EB873","Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2023","31456","2375",,,"Size: 256GB, Color: Black, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed Premium","B08PP5MSVB","Size","256GB","Color","Black","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed Premium"

After I had gotten the phone fixed It had fallen again on the carpet only for it to go completely black and glitched out AGAIN. This is by far the worst experience I’ve had on and I do not recommend this at all to anybody looking to purchase an iPhone. This seller doesn’t care.","R3HGTD3FSR28IT",,,,,,,,,,"12","DO NOT BUY THIS IS A PIECE OF TRASH!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HGTD3FSR28IT","Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2024","31456","2375",,,"Size: 64GB, Color: Black, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PP5MSVB","Size","64GB","Color","Black","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

That was not the case for me. I got the best option for the phone and it came with scratches and chips all over it. Battery life was 88%. By far nowhere near what was expected. To add to my frustration the seller put a “signature requirement” on my package delivery with no indication I would need to do so. So not only did I miss the first delivery attempt but I had to pretty much watch my front door all day to make sure I didnt miss it again. Aggravating to say the least after feeling like I’ve waisted precious time and money. I’m genuinely unhappy with this entire experience. If I didn’t desperately need this phone due to the current one being destroyed. I’d be sending it back immediately and finding a new device elsewhere. Not recommended. Edit: I’ve just found out that only one speaker works! To top it all off when I’m on a call with someone it sounds like they’re talking to me through a tin can! I can barely hear anything either.

I called Amazon and they would only offer a return via Whole Foods or Amazon Fresh - which I do not have near my home. I was told a return through USPS or ups would not be possible. Amazon said I could contact the seller, which I did, then the seller responded that they were not liable and that Amazon would have to provide resolution.

I thought maybe I left something on and drained it so I put it to charge, and it wasn’t charging. I decided to look at the battery health to see if it dropped and there was a notification saying that the battery in this phone is a non-genuine Apple battery. So basically, they sent me a phone with a fake battery that is now turning off every few minutes and won’t charge. I am now returning it and hope they have the decency to refund it full price. Thank god I still had my old phone because I am leaving the country in a couple of days and can’t afford to get another one before I leave. What is the most upsetting is that I did my research on the seller and it seemed to have very good reviews and the bad ones seemed to not be the seller’s fault.

I bought an iPhone 12 in “excellent” condition. The phone arrived with scratches all over the screen, and clearly had been dropped because there was a gash in the side of the phone. I was upset but thought whatever for that price- I couldn’t find it that cheap anywhere else. I put a case on it and screen protector, and tried to make sure everything was working. I tried making a call, and when the phone was on speaker I could hear everything clearly; when the phone was off of speaker, I couldn’t hear ANYTHING at ALL. I sent it back two days after it was delivered. It’s been a week and I still haven’t heard anything else from this seller or received my refund on this phone. This was nothing but a headache and waste of my time. It’s depressing because I really wanted/needed this phone! They still haven’t made this right with me, didn’t offer anything for my trouble, not a discount or anything if I repurchased with them. Don’t make my mistake and buy elsewhere.

It worked fine on my Tmobile account for about one month. The ""5G"" was never fast, and while at work in my office I would have almost no internet connection through cellular data, even though I am on the unlimited max plan. Then recently, the phone stopped recognizing my sim card. I reset the phone, cleaned my sim card, then even physically went to a TMOBILE store and had them make and activate a brand new sim card for me. This worked for about one hour before the phone stopped reading the sim again and only allowed me to make SOS calls. Needless to say, during this entire ordeal where I called T-mobile multiple times thinking it was a sim card error that lasted 2 days (before I gave up hope and got another phone), I missed several important texts and calls. I then asked for a replacement from Amazon, since that's who I bought it from, but it turns out they are not the company the refurbishes and sells these phones as they claim on the listing, its actually some third party ""tek"" company. I will not get a replacement as I wanted and instead am still waiting on my refund. So I hope this helps the next person, DO NOT buy used Iphones from Amazon","RMMT6YKHVKFT8",,,,,,,,,,"36","Worked great for 1 month...","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMMT6YKHVKFT8","Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2023","31456","2375",,,"Size: 64GB, Color: Black, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PP5MSVB","Size","64GB","Color","Black","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

I haven’t chosen premium as I’ve been very happy with the condition of the phones as just renewed. I ordered an iPhone 12 a couple weeks ago and was very happy with it so I ordered a second renewed iPhone 12 that should have been in excellent condition. The phone I received was awful. Opening the box you could tell it had been dropped as the case was dented. Thinking I would give it a chance I got my old phone backup loaded only to find the top half of the screen didn’t work and the display jumped around so much it took me two hours to reset the phone so I could return it. This phone could not have been tested. All my other phones had come from New York area and this one came from California so I’m not sure if there’s a severe quality control problem there as this phone should never have been sent out.

I got a phone that felt and looked like it was brand new for really cheap. The screen that was used to replace it is not an apple made screen. Now I am having issues with it. The screen pops out of the casing itself and I push it back in which is not a big deal and I honestly thought that was kinda cool. But then a random line showed up in the middle of my screen, sometimes it disappears but most of the time it is right in my face. Now the screen is starting to pick up touches that I don’t make. It’ll start doing stuff when I’m not even touching it. And the bottom of the screen(spacebar and home swipe thing) are unresponsive something and very inconsistent. I am very upset with this purchase now and wish I didn’t buy it. It is taking me forever just to write this review because the screen is all messed up. I would not buy this if I were you.

They won't do a general send a new one and send back the old one. You're on your own for sending it back, and no exchange possible. Would have to pay and shipping charges over again, wait at least a week before having it recredited, and then take business elsewhere. Yes it was stupid of me to buy international off of here, but they said their 90 Warranty applies and offered it for international order. In reality it's a ripoff and now going to have to pay for a repair. A flaw this obvious really should have beeb caught for a rebuilt phone. They should never have released this from the factory. So naturally this can happen with one you buy. For me, a complete ripoff","RZQ6VXHKKKS5P",,,,,,,,,,"24","Bad Flaw And Impossible To Fix","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZQ6VXHKKKS5P","Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2023","31456","2375",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Red, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PP5MSVB","Size","128GB","Color","Red","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

Return the device back with no further resolution In the event, that we do not hear back we will proceed to return the device back to the address we have on file.

Did not receive the charging cable or wall piece and when I requested to just be refunded the price difference between a phone in excellent condition vs one in good condition I was offered $25 at best. I find it ridiculous that there is such a large price gap between the two phone conditions when the seller prices the items, but yet the seller doesn’t believe they are actually worth that when offering a refund for the difference. Poor customer service and a poor quality product. If you’re going to price the phone qualities so far apart at least offer the difference when you give someone a low quality product. I should’ve just requested a full refund instead of wasting my time thinking the company would just make it right by compensating for the difference. I won’t be buying from them because of principle. If they want to sell their merchandise for different prices based upon quality, they should also hold themselves to that standard when offering to make things right, instead of insulting their customers.","R6KZALRNKMR4O","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41RoA42C5nL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Dz0IaOYuL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6188xU9maUL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61W9nj7Wh9L._SY88.jpg",,,,,,"17","Quality not as described.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R6KZALRNKMR4O","Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2023","31456","2375",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Blue, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PP5MSVB","Size","128GB","Color","Blue","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

Then on December 14, almost exactly 2 months later, the audio on the phone app stopped working. Suddenly I was like a mime with a phone. If I did a video call, I'd have to perform interpretive dance. I'm a pretty fair tech geek. After running complete diagnostics at home and at the Apple store, both on the software and hardware, it turned out to be a $250 hardware problem. This was most likely because when the the vendor swapped in a new (non-Apple) battery, they did not seat it correctly. To be fair, iPhone 12's are also known for having phone audio problems (muting audio weirdly.) But after extensive diagnostics, as I said, it did turn out to be a hardware problem. It seems to me that a refurbished phone should work longer than 2 months. And usually, they do. Just not this one. Now, maybe I could have gone to the trouble of returning and replacing this phone, But even if they let me do that, who among us can be phone-less for a week? Even if you bought the insurance coverage, you'd still be out the phone for that long. Normally, I don't mind unplugging on nights or weekends, but I need my phone for work. So, I paid the $250 to Apple to fix it in a couple of hours. You do you, but honestly, until the vendor addresses that problem, I would steer clear, especially if it's an iPhone 12. Good luck, and may the odds be ever in your favor.","R21UGW97URZZ7R",,,,,,,,,,"43","Generic battery, ended up needing to replace faceplate within 2 months","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21UGW97URZZ7R","Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2024","31456","799",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Black, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PP5MSVB","Size","128GB","Color","Black","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

Apple won’t fix it because they said it’s an aftermarket screen they put on. Contacted the seller about the speaker and they told me to send it back, but then I would be out of a phone for a while having to ship it through the mail(as a mother, I need to have a phone on me at all times)…. I paid the extra money to get the highest quality of refurbishment…. Also When I received the phone, I had noticed a couple of dents around the back, but I didn’t mind since I put OtterBox on it. But on the back, you can see the back screen was replaced before because it’s not closed all the way…. I’m assuming that means my phones not water resistant , But like I said, I just keep it heavy duty case on it… I had to save up for a while to get this phone, so I was kind of disappointing that it has a couple of issues.

This is 3 times the distance of their ""acceptable condition."" Normally there is a small gap between the glass and the frame, but you can clearly see the glass is up against the frame where the dents are located and you can easily feel the damage to the glass and frame. Nowhere near what i purchased. ORDERED THIS- Excellent condition - Cosmetic condition: Excellent (Screen: no scratches. Body: no signs of cosmetic damage (scratches, dents, etc.) will be visible when the product is held 12 inches away). - Functional condition: Fully Functional (exceeds 80% of original battery life, generic or OEM accessories and packaging provided). GOT SOMETHING CONSIDERED AS THIS (if you would call it that) Acceptable condition - Cosmetic condition: Acceptable (Screen: may have a small number of shallow scratches, invisible when the screen is turned on. Body: light scratches, clearly visible when holding the device 12 inches away and perceptible to touch). - Functional condition: Fully Functional (exceeds 80% of original battery life, generic or OEM accessories and packaging provided). UPDATE - These phones will go through a 3rd party even though it says “Amazon Renewed.” The 3rd party seller took the old phone back and exchanged it for a phone better suited for excellent condition. Battery was, also, at 100% condition which I find odd considering it’s an IPhone 12 and 15s are the new phone. Time will tell of how well this phone works.

Shipping delayed a few days, then delivered to an Amazon ""hub"" rather than my home. I never had anything delivered elsewhere, but maybe that's a new option and I missed it when ordering. Packed in a nice 'Amazon renewed' box that held contents securely, but that box was then just tossed into a much larger generic Amazon box for shipping--no padding, no airbags, etc. Flimsy generic lightning cable included, along with a generic and obviously well used 5w charger (these accessories match what the listing indicated, so no problem). Phone is in generally good cosmetic condition--back and sides seem very good, so was probably in a case; screen though has two distinct scratches toward the bottom. Both are about a half inch long and both are visible at arm's length. The plastic protective sticky sheet over the screen was fine, but the one over the camera lens was too sticky and left residue on the lens that I am unable to get off totally. Phone booted up fine, and Battery Health & Charging in settings says the battery is at 92%. However, the Battery Stats shortcut which pulls info from Apple Analytics has more accurate and detailed info. It shows the phone has gone through 320 complete charging cycles and the actual capacity is currently 88.9%. This is slightly below the 90% battery life that Renewed Premium is supposed to have. Overall, with the screen scratches, sticky residue and slightly below advertised battery life, I'd give this iPhone 12 about a 7 out of 10. If I can resolve the camera lens residue, it'd be an 8 or 8.5. If I can't find a way to safely get the sticky residue off the camera lens, I'll have to return the phone. :-)","R384J53R3C763K",,,,,,,,,,"14","""Premium Renewed"" not quite premium","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R384J53R3C763K","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2023","31456","799",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Black, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed Premium","B08PP5MSVB","Size","128GB","Color","Black","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed Premium"

I’ve already been through the massive headache of setting up this phone and logging into everything. I charged it first and I waited until I knew the phone would power on. I thought the battery went down quickly for a newly refurbished phone. This morning, I plugged it in to charge back-up from 20% and it tops out at 96% and will go no higher. I’m also not thrilled about chipping on the metal around the camera lenses of this phone. I picked a refurbished phone in the highest quality condition available (excellent) and from a seller with good reviews. If I return it, I have to go through all of the setup again.

The mute switch was filled with what I'm assuming was dead skin, enough to obscure the red marking. It should have been cleaned before being sold at this grade. The battery capacity should exceed 90% and this phone just clocks in at 90%. Not a big deal at 1% difference, but not what's listed for the renewed premium grade. The screen and body were overall blemish and scratch free although there was a residue around the camera lenses that should have been cleaned. I considered returning the phone, but I don't have time to go without one and the hassle of swapping data from my old phone.

The phone was received nicely boxed and free of any cosmetic defects, looks new. However, I tried to put a screen protector (tempered glass) on the phone, and the defects were found. There are indentations in the screen. These indentations seem to have no affect on the operation (yet to be noticed) but prevent the glass from laying flat with no bubbles. The screen protectors came in a 3 pack so I tried 3 times, same locations. I know doing the same thing multiple time and expecting a different outcome kinda means I’m insane, but oh well. There is not enough time to return and retry before her birthday so we are going to go with this one without a screen protector at risk. So much for renewed “premium”.

I bought the used iPhone 12 unlocked but I finally had to go to the Boost mobile store and they spent over an hour setting it up. After about a week, the screen froze in the super magnification mode. The phone wouldn't open. It wouldn't recognize my face and it wouldn't recognize the lock code numbers. This happened 2 times and it worked after I let the battery run down and recharged it and I was able to restart it and open it. However the third time, I couldn't seem to run it down. It doesn't help that the iPhone battery level is unreadable. There was an Apple store at a nearby mall. It had a half dozen technicians. The one I got had me do the recommended things like pressing the side buttons and all and it didn't work. So I had to reset it. I noticed that at the other stations, all of the other techs were telling people to reset their phones, too. Resetting loses your unbackedup data like contacts. The apps have to be reloaded too. Fortunately my phone was new and I didn't have many of those.

This one was for my grand-daughter for Christmas. I had originally purchased a red version Iphone 12 but had to return it due to weak screen at full brightness it was only half as bright as her current Iphone 10Xxr which implies to me of heavy usage from previous owner and weak battery. Still waiting on refund for that phone. I have come to understand that you must wait on the suppliers of the phones to refund your purchase however I think Amazon implies they are guaranteeing your purchase and like all other amazon returns they will refund your money this is not what happens.. I also find Amazon is beginning to slip in customer service areas that were once routinely always taken care of, takes a week to get a package now refunds get the run around etc. Its a Christmas present so I have to get her another one quickly so I try again with the white Iphone 12 . After getting it I immediately notice marks on the screen and slight dents on the side of the phone. It slightly has dull screen too not as bad as the red iphone but not as bright as her current iphone 10. She is satisfied with it shes 12... If it was for me it would go back too... I will not be purchasing any more renewed phones...

Well I would say that it is not in excellent condition but in okay condition. It is definitely refurbished. Cons: It came in dead, with scuffs and chips all over the paint, a weird little black spot in the screen, and the battery is only at 77% capacity. Pros: Functions fine, holds an alright charge, easy to use, no problems setting up carrier. This phone physically is beat up, and functions as it should. I’m not satisfied with the price I paid for the sheer quality of this phone, somebody definitely over exaggerated its greatness, because it’s PHYSICALLY not in excellent condition. But for now it will do! So if you want a phone for short money that functions fine and don’t care about the physical appearance, this phone is for you! But if you expect a fairly new, barely scratched phone, look elsewhere my friend! 3/5 phone.","RBV676BHUDPHP","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61CVpk4JclL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Gqie0b6FL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Qa3J69RXL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61RfxWE6lfL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61VZ2mbTZUL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/713qb5h8iPL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71goznlooiL._SY88.jpg",,,"35","Not excellent, good if you are balling on a budget!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RBV676BHUDPHP","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024","31456","799",,,"Size: 64GB, Color: Black, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PP5MSVB","Size","64GB","Color","Black","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

We got a protector for it to prevent scratches, as well as a phone cover. I consider those standard accessories for any phone. Overall battery life is fair. It is a reconditioned phone, and for a price you can get a new battery installed by someone else, or do it yourself. I've done both. Thankfully Apple has a way for you to tell if the battery is shot. This one was about 20% used, and won't go above that. Easy enough to have an external battery with you. As my friend is new to the iPhone world, he had some questions. Most things he figured out himself, even though he's not technically apt. At all. Facial recognition works really well. I like that it allows you to put in (2) faces. Either one of you without a mask, and one with ... or another person. It doesn't really care. I also like that Apple doesn't send that facial data anywhere.

I've had bad experiences with used phones in the past so I thought this would be a good way to guarantee a quality product. The phone arrived last night and I set it up this morning. It looks well-maintained and works pretty well so far, but the battery's max capacity is 86%. This is blatantly the opposite of the product description; when I contacted Amazon customer service, they apologized profusely and offered $50 in ""credit."" I said that was fine, I just wanted the difference between a Renewed and Renewed Premium item (or close enough) but I realized quickly that this promotional credit was not gift card money. I still haven't even received notification that I have the $50, and it's not showing anywhere in my account. I would strongly, strongly avoid Renewed or Renewed Premium products unless you're really strapped and looking to save a few bucks OR you don't mind rolling the dice with a maybe-fine product. Again, phone seems to work OK but it's Renewed at best, nothing Premium about it.","R37MP7EZJTISQH","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51C64zeaKoL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,,,"5","Phone looks great but battery at 86%","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37MP7EZJTISQH","Reviewed in the United States on October 30, 2023","31456","799",,,"Size: 64GB, Color: Blue, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed Premium","B08PP5MSVB","Size","64GB","Color","Blue","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed Premium"

Visited T-Mobile store, repeated phone calls to incompetent associates at T-Mobile call centers, placed on hold for over 20 minutes, etc. Highly recommend you think it through before you chose a refurbished phone with a specific carrier. You might be better to get one unlocked, and pay the up charge to Amazon Refurb.

The battery’s health was ‘significantly degraded’ per the settings. I was expecting the device would be in Excellent condition. I realize this is a refurbished product and may have had higher expectations than experienced.","RTEH8WPLHMJOR",,,,,,,,,,,"Not sold on refurbished phones","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTEH8WPLHMJOR","Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2024","31456","799",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Black, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PP5MSVB","Size","128GB","Color","Black","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

We took it in for repairs and found that it had a third party battery and needed an apple battery. Seemed like an easy fix that we could live with. Then we also found out that the front camera was third party too and they couldn't replace the apple battery if it had a third party camera. So the phone was now useless to us. We ended up having to purchase a new phone. We understand that we were buying a refurbished phone, but if you know that apple is specific with the requirements for their parts and that the phone will stop functioning normally with third party parts why do you use them and cause such inconvenience for your customers? Why not use genuine parts and then increase your asking price? It would still be under the price for a new phone.

However sometimes the screen still has a mini freeze. It will have a little hiccup or stutter and that was the main reason I wanted to replace my XR. The screen did have damage to it as well. It was small scratches and one small gauge kind of in the screen. I used a screen protector and it concealed the screen marks perfectly without a single air bubble anywhere. Says more about the screen protector than this phone. Sometimes the screen glitches when I try to type something. Even in apps that don’t require internet or any kind of signal for anything. Just the notes section. It’s really frustrating to have a constant reminder that I’m too poor to afford something better. I’ve requested a refund. This phone is only useful if you’re desperate. It’s not worth $200 at all. It’s also slightly smaller than the XR and I don’t like that. I do have a ton of storage though at least. So that’s probably the only real plus. I can have more than just a couple apps and my Spotify downloads don’t kill the storage space. It’s not really a light phone, which is fine to be fair. Feels like it will be harder to drop because it’s like a small weight in your hands. But still I’m sour about the size. You know what, for the annoyance and frustration, I’m doing two stars, it’s just and inconvenience now because it’s like it’s already on its way to the trash. The color is freaking beautiful though. If your on the wild side and don’t use a case, the color lavender or lilac is sure to impress. For $200 I would expect nothing less than a perfectly working phone. This one is literally already starting with the same issues my last phone started having. And look where we are now. I originally was going to return it then I changed my mind and decided to use it. I should have left it untouched and saved myself the hassle.","R1O3X9DHRW4L60",,,,,,,,,,,"Not worth $200.

Overall I adore the functionality of the phone considering it has more storage and is able to run games which my old iPhone 6s couldn’t do, though I feel like the screens on the phones this seller sells are incredibly fragile! First phone arrived with a broken screen which had the corners sticking up ever so slightly from the edges of the phone, and the white phone I bought after getting my refund (which was the first return I had ever done and took overly too long) now has a crack in the screen from falling about a foot into the floor even with a case. The thing that really bothers me about this is the fact my iPhone 6s, which I’ve had much longer than this new yet refurbished iPhone 12, doesn’t have anything broken on it externally at all even though I have similar cases on both phones! Battery health was also significantly degraded at 77%. I didn’t mind the battery health, though it doesn’t quite make the feeling of the crack in my screen any better considering I haven’t had this phone very long. My old iPhone 6s is also refurbished and bought from Walmart, though it honestly feels more durable than what this seller sells. I can’t tell if I just got unlucky twice with Amazon or if there’s something wrong with the phones sold by this seller. Either way, I don’t recommend buying a phone from here and would instead suggest buying directly from Apple.

Unfortunately, that was not the case. On May 15th—less than two months later—the phone completely died. It started with a constant reboot loop. The Apple logo just kept flashing, and no soft reset helped. Plugging it into a charger did nothing—it won’t hold a charge, just blinks the logo endlessly. To make matters worse, since day one, the phone made a rattling noise inside—as if something was loose. It didn’t seem to affect performance at first, so I ignored it. In hindsight, it probably was a sign that the phone wasn’t structurally sound. I will say that the seller was responsive and helpful when I reached out, which is why I'm giving two stars instead of one. Still, I’m extremely disappointed in the quality of a product labeled ""Amazon Premium Renewed."" I expected a device that at least lasted beyond 60 days. Would not recommend based on this experience.","R14BOLUDPC9D7N",,,,,,,,,,,"Disappointed with Amazon Premium Renewed – Phone Failed in Less Than 2 Months","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14BOLUDPC9D7N","Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2025","31456","663",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: White, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed Premium","B08PP5MSVB","Size","128GB","Color","White","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed Premium"

Bought iPhone 12 renewed, received and appeared in excellent condition. Transferred info from my phone, working well except on day 1, after completing a call, screen went black, completely unresponsive to all attempts of changing (unable to turn on, off, or get anything else). But, only lasted 1-2 minutes and suddenly came on. Day 4 same black screen occurred after a call, but not resolving. Just sent old phone in as trade-in, obviously unable to call customer svc, went to online chat on my computer, not an easy task but typing all symptoms then waiting for responses, 1st with assistant, then transferred to someone, repeating some of conversation, transferred to someone else; all close to 2 hrs just explaining my issue. During the end of this, the phone suddenly came on, after 4+ hrs of black screen. Have not tried calling anyone but using text and internet options. If happens again, I could lose all phone data - contacts, photos, subscriptions, invoices, - so much we have on there! My options, per emails with customer service, were to contact seller and see what was proposed but no automatic replacement. Main recommendation was to return phone to Amazon and refund expected usually about 30 days, maybe more. I have already sent in my old phone. Before returning this new phone I need to purchase another so I can hopefully still get data transferred. So much for a safe inexpensive option of buying renewed. Will have to spend another several hundred bucks for yet another phone, hoping this damaged one will last long enough to transfer data, And what does that mean as to my trade in? Still don’t have all answers from customer svc. This has not been a great experience, especially since I don’t have a phone I can trust to make any calls, and don’t know what the issue is so am nervous I may lose all data in the phone at any point.

I ordered an ""Excellent"" Condition iPhone 12 128gb in blue to replace a lost phone at work. Needed something to use, so I wanted something inexpensive, and good. I landed on an iPhone 12 due to the good reviews left on it. However, my first experience with this type of ""Renewed/Refurbished"" service, was less than adequate. Cosmetics: Scratches. Advertises can't see nicks or scratches past 12 inches, but I can see it in a dark room (where it's hard to see scratches to begin with) from over 2 feet away! The screen was full on scratched up underneath a screen protector (which was provided), the sides were full of nicks, and somehow, there's a big white scratch on the back glass of the phone (which is notorious for not being able to be scratched. Outside Cleanliness: The charge port came with dust in it, not letting me charge it. Ontop of that, the speakers sound muffled, leading me to believe there's dust INSIDE the phone. It also came wrapped with multiple fingerprints all over the screen. Battery: Not gonna lie, I got nothing bad on the battery. It came with 87% which is decent and advertised. Overall, yes, I did submit a request for it to be replaced. Although it is fully functional, the speakers and charge port are still dirty, and I heard my mic is also muffled. The scratches and Nicks are something to be tolerable with seeing as how it was pre-owned. I will Update when I get my Replacement","R2AWSBOQ029XPA",,,,,,,,,,"2","Excellent Condition?

Also the renew option only has a 3 months warranty, which pales in comparison to the premium option which is a year.

The phone arrived with scratches deep into the metal and what looked like a circular image burned into the upper half of the screen, centered, about the size of a quarter. The screen had a greenish tint, and I couldn't get passed the language selection part of setup. Anyway, it turned out it had some version of iOS on it that was neither factory nor up to date. You'd think any of these issues would have been noticed by a human being before me, right? But anyway, I did manage to get the phone updated with itunes and a computer, and it managed to boot up. The camera is blurry and bright, the backlight is only randomly functional, and it's all so very green looking. As of writing this, I have ordered the replacement, so please take this with the grain of salt that I may end up being in the group of satisfied customers in a week or so. However, just be aware that the first phone you get may be a brick.","R25GPE12SZV87T",,,,,,,,,,"2","Feels like gambling","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R25GPE12SZV87T","Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2023","31456","663",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Black, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PP5MSVB","Size","128GB","Color","Black","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

My daughter had complained of the battery but our time frame had expired so we could not reach out to this vendor. We mentioned this issue as well to the shop we brought the phone to fix the crack. They let us know that the battery the phone came with was defective and that there were glass pieces left from previous repairs. This has left a bad experience for us as we basically had to invest what we paid for the phone to get it repairs. Ended spending more and the phone did not last a year.

Loved the phone when it arrived. Condition was good, screen clear. I was upgrading from an iPhone 8 so you can imagine the delight as I discovered all the new features, the ease of use, and I really loved the mini size. On the first phone call I made I was surprised at the distorted, gravely sound. I struggled to hear the caller. Maximum volume did not improve it. I tried other calls with different people, same result. I then tried playing music. The distorted sound was familiar, the sound you get when your old car speakers have been played too loud too long. I attempted troubleshooting with apple service. They analyzed the phone (however they do that online) and said it was fine. So, I requested a return. The Lesson? Don’t break your heart by buying used, and while you’re at it, just get the latest model.","R1175NR9RVHB7A",,,,,,,,,,"2","Love the phone EXCEPT: Speakers were blown out","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1175NR9RVHB7A","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2023","31456","663",,,"Size: 256GB, Color: Blue, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PP5MSVB","Size","256GB","Color","Blue","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

(phone set on both data and wifi); the touch screen is frequently insensitive to touch, more often at the upper right periphery of the screen (Are my fingers too cold?).

The phone boasts an improved camera system with AI-driven enhancements, capturing stunning 4K video. Compared to my previous iPhone SE, the iPhone 12 delivers noticeably sharper and superior video quality. Although the phone arrived later than expected, I'm pleased with the purchase overall. This is the third phone I've bought through Amazon, and the first one that worked as expected. The first two were not authorized for service in the USA. Based on my experience, I recommend Amazon’s Renewed cell phone program for those looking to reduce waste by recycling and reusing electronics. However, the phone arrived with a few dents and messy adhesive, which took some effort to clean off using rubbing alcohol. Shipping could have been faster, and I experienced a delay of about a week and a half before receiving the phone. I also wish Amazon would disclose the seller associated with your purchase before you buy, as some sellers provide better products than others. Fortunately, this particular seller did a great job renewing the phone. The 256 GB of storage is a huge plus, leaving me with about 64 GB free after setup. It also came with a charger cable, but unfortunately, there was no official product manual, AirPods, or original box included. If you don’t mind waiting and a bit of uncertainty, Amazon’s renewed phones tend to work out well thanks to their generous guarantee and return policy. It would be great, however, if refunds for defective purchases were processed more quickly. Lastly, Siri on this model feels different compared to my iPhone SE, likely because I don’t have the hardware needed to take full advantage of the new Apple Intelligence features on this device. This product meets my expectations and hardware tests thus far. The battery life is good, and I was able to use it for about all day without needing to plug it in.","RILHZXDF23T1T",,,,,,,,,,"56","Good Working Condition","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RILHZXDF23T1T","Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2024","31456","1226",,,"Size: 256GB, Color: Blue, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PP5MSVB","Size","256GB","Color","Blue","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

I transition to this one from an iPhone 8 Plus (only because that one is like, not receiving updates anymore), and it was a bit jarring at first, but I got used to using this new one after like a month. right out of the box the screen and metal shell were in really good condition with only one scratch on the upper right of the casing. The screen is perfectly responsive even through a protective screen and all the haptics/gestures work perfectly. One thing that this device does that I really don't like, is that it has had this weird flicker whenever the screen is very dark or black. this iPhone has been doing this since the day I received it, and initially I thought nothing of it; then I remembered that my old iPhone doesnt do this at all.. I don't know what it is, but it's very odd and at times interferes with some of the ways I use the device. I opted not to return it because other people I know who have this version of iPhone said their phone did that at some point too and they either ignored it or they updated their device and the problem resolved itself. I had to remember that this is a used handset and this issue with how it handles black is literally one of two faults that the item has. The vender was pretty meticulous with support, packaging, instructions, and they even included a new charger in the box that works very well and is a bit thicker than the OEM parts so it's still in good shape too. I think it was worth keeping overall, but will still wonder about this flicker for the duration of the time that I use this iPhone.","R1JJ9XQNQCK6HM",,,,,,,,,,"8","OLED Flicker is Very Annoying","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1JJ9XQNQCK6HM","Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2025","31456","1226",,,"Size: 256GB, Color: Red, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PP5MSVB","Size","256GB","Color","Red","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

So far camera works, keypad works, I’m satisfied with the physical appearance and the shipping was fast as promised. HOWEVER, in both the item description (as a premium condition phone) and on the certified premium checklist card included in the box with phone, it is promised to have a phone battery capacity of “over 90%” though the battery health measurement in the phone settings states 83%. I’m not dissatisfied enough with that alone to return, but I would hope anyone reading reviews sees this and knows that the promise of anything close to 90% is not a valid promise. In hindsight, I’d likely take my chances with the standard quality option and not spend the extra money on premium. I have a feeling it’s the same phone quality standard either way and you’re just paying more for verbiage with premium.","R2VRYDT0749LCY",,,,,,,,,,"7","Overall fine, but battery health not as promised","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VRYDT0749LCY","Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2025","31456","1226",,,"Size: 256GB, Color: White, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed Premium","B08PP5MSVB","Size","256GB","Color","White","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed Premium"

I am a rising junior now. Though my XR did my well over the years, she recently started shutting off on me at random times, would die after 30 minutes of use after being charged fully. I was just wayyyy past due for a new phone, so I got this one. This was one of my first big girl purchases, so I was a little worried that something was going to be wrong with the phone, seeing as I saw quite a few reviews complaining of issues with their phones, but I haven't had any problems yet. Face ID works perfectly, extremely minor scratches (so unnoticeable I was only able to tell because I was strictly looking for them), easy to switch over to my carrier (literally just inserted the old sim card, and 30 minutes later EVERYTHING transferred over with no issues). Honestly, this is a REALLY good deal if you're looking for a more cheap route than having to buy a phone straight from Apple. Now, the only issue, which I dont fully see as an issue and youll understand why but the battery. The biggest issue with my old phone was how quickly it died. It was impossible to go out for longer than 3 hours without my phone dying. The first setting I checked on the new phone was the battery capacity, and although I was really really upset when I saw it was also at 80% like my last phone, I dont really know if that number is fully true. I recieved my phone yesterday, and havent charged it since the afternoon of that day, and it is still on 49% which would NEVER happen with my old phone. SO, I put the rating down one star because it does still say that the battery capacity is 80%, but I just havent really seen that as of yet! Hope you guys found my review useful, and I highly HIGHLY recommend buying this product. Just make sure to double-check the ratings of the seller you're buying from. For me, the black color of the iPhone 12 came from a different buyer than the blue color. The black phone color seller has 3.2-star ratings while the blue phone seller has a 4.5-star rating, so I went with a color I wouldn't have usually gone with to higher my chances of receiving a phone in better condition!","R18BO5AUQMV056",,,,,,,,,,"22","Highly Recommend","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R18BO5AUQMV056","Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2024","31456","1226",,,"Size: 64GB, Color: Blue, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PP5MSVB","Size","64GB","Color","Blue","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

Like others, I was a little hesitant. But hey, it's covered by the same Amazon return policy for 30 days. I got a testing app to do all the tests, I did the home tests of the camera(s). All good! I got a little freaked out when I looked at the battery and it said 75%. But that was the current charge. When I plugged it in overnight, it went up to 100%. UPDATE: okay, i found the real way to check the absolute battery health. it was 81%. There was a sticker plonked on the back that I was worried wouldn't come off without a fight. Nope, once I got the edge pulled up, it came right off, no residue or anything. The unlocked phone did the whole eSIM thing with USMobile no problem.

Here’s a breakdown of my thoughts: Performance: The A14 Bionic chip delivers impressive performance. Everything from browsing to gaming has been smooth and responsive. I’m glad I chose this model—I can easily multitask without any noticeable lag. Condition: The phone arrived in good condition overall, with minimal signs of wear. However, I did notice a few light scratches on the screen that weren’t mentioned in the description. While they don’t impact functionality, it was a bit disappointing. Camera Quality: The camera takes fantastic photos, and the Night Mode feature is a game-changer. I love capturing memories, and this phone does an excellent job, even in tricky lighting situations. Battery Life: The battery life is decent but could be better. I find myself needing to charge it by the end of the day, especially with heavy usage. It’s not a dealbreaker, but I was expecting a bit more endurance. Value for Money: Considering the savings compared to a brand-new device, this refurbished iPhone 12 offers great value. For anyone on a budget, it’s a solid option. In summary, I highly recommend the refurbished iPhone 12 for anyone looking for a reliable smartphone. Just be sure to check the condition carefully beforehand. Happy with my purchase overall!","R1991LSJCXQ5CU",,,,,,,,,,"42","Great Phone, Minor Flaws, but Worth It!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1991LSJCXQ5CU","Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2024","31456","1226",,,"Size: 64GB, Color: Red, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PP5MSVB","Size","64GB","Color","Red","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

My order was placed on March 31, 2023, and it arrived on May 4, 2023. The unboxing experience was excellent. An unadorned white cardboard box labeled ""Amazon Renewed"" on the top and some device info on the back. Inside, side-by-side, two recessed trays, one for the iPhone (covered by a clear plastic film) and the second for a USB 5V power adapter and 3' Lightning cable. A ""OPEN ME FIRST"" sleeve with several cards inside: HI THERE, WE'VE GOT YOU COVERED, QUICK START GUIDE, SIM REMOVAL TOOL, and INSPECTION TEST CERTIFICATE. Cosmetically the phone looked brand new. No noticeable blemishes (just a tiny scratch near the Lightning connection). So, after powering on and setting up the iPhone 12, I checked a few things. WiFi and Bluetooth were okay. Face ID okay. The battery was at 81% charge, with a Max Capacity (Battery Health) of 89%. iOS was at version 16.3.1, which I upgraded to 16.4.1, then 16.4.1(a). The back of the box noted ""BH 91%"" and the Inspection Certificate noted that ""Your Device"" – A2172 BH91 – was ""Tested in New Jersey"" on 03/24/2023"" and ""Battery Health 90%+ confirmed."" So, in the time (~6 weeks) between inspection and arrival, this iPhone lost 2% of max battery capacity. Is this typical (as in other reviews)? Is this a big deal? Well, in my case 89% BH probably is good enough. The renewed iPhone 12 is not my primary smartphone. And the fully charged battery lasts longer than my old iPhone SE's.

I even weighed the benefits of buying used versus new. I made my choice with this iPhone 12 and even paid an extra $10 to have it delivered sooner. When it got here I was very impressed as it had 100% battery life left. The transfer from my old iPhone took a while due to the fact it first had to be updated to the latest iOS version. After the update everything else was simple. But here's the problem. The Wi-Fi icon grayed out after 2 days leaving the phone unable to connect to the internet. I did hours of research looking at 10 different fixes and tried them all three or four different times. None of them worked and most reviewers who addressed this problem said if the fixes don't work it is probably a hardware problem with probably the internal antenna and that needed to be fixed by an authorized iPhone repair shop or someone else who knows what they're doing. That wasn't going to happen so I unfortunately had to send the phone back.","R2BXY33QMTQXB6",,,,,,,,,,"5","Everything you want in an iPhone","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2BXY33QMTQXB6","Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2024","31456","1226",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Green, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PP5MSVB","Size","128GB","Color","Green","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

Unfortunately the battery life is not the greatest. The pixel I could use for two days without charging. This iPhone, I end up having to charge after dinner time. And I don’t use it that much.

The battery health has gone down to 89% after a little over a year of having it. Granted, I have a habit of overcharging my phone overnight when I’m asleep so that may be the cause. I still highly recommend this phone in 2024. Update February 2023: I still have the phone and the battery health is still at 100%. The phone is still working fine and I haven’t noticed any slow downs yet. I don’t regret this purchase! I believe I got lucky and got what feels like a brand new iPhone 12. I know the phone is old and I really am under the impression I got a brand new one that was sitting around for a while. Everything works fine and I’m really happy that when checking the battery health, it said 100%! I checked under direct light for scratches and scuffs. There was some minor scratches; very thin which looks like finger nail scratches. But from arm lengths distance, I couldn’t make out where the scratches were and I’m happy with it. My Samsung Galaxy S10e of 2.5 years malfunctioned recently and I needed a new phone but I didn’t want to break the bank. I did a lot of research prior to purchase on which older model was more “bang for your buck.” I found that the iPhone 12 in 2022 was a worthy purchase considering it has a great camera, pretty display and the potential to see several more years of support from Apple (support being firmware updates which tend to include new features to your phone’s software). Nothing is guaranteed but a lot of people mentioned much older iPhones are still receiving updates. I do have a case on it but I don’t prefer any screen protectors because I want the most out of the display. If I break it, my carrier will fix it for a low cost. From now on, I’m going to buy older models of phones to save money and hope I get a quality phone like this one!","R3KLBXB1Z6NEWY","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ChiBaegSL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71NfsBQPy-L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71tXrTi9rEL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,"62","Got one with 100% Battery Health, minor scratching on back","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3KLBXB1Z6NEWY","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2022","31456","1226",,,"Size: 64GB, Color: Black, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PP5MSVB","Size","64GB","Color","Black","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

There are no scratches at all. I'm guessing that it lived in a quality case, upon arrival and inspection I placed it in one right away. The phone works perfectly, I'm a little worried about the battery strength and lasting power. I do play my music constantly so that might be a problem. We will see and I will update but right now I'm extremely happy. Now that I have had the phone for a while I feel ready to give it a more complete review. I'm still very happy that I saved money with the acceptable version. The battery is still a concern as there are times when it does seem to discharge faster than I think that it should, but it has never left me stranded. The front glass seems to have been replaced by a lesser quality glass as I do have issues reading my fingertips sometimes in comparison to previous iPhones. Again this is an inconvenience not a serious problem. Overall I'm really happy with the phone a so glad to have an iPhone again. I really hated the Android's that I have had to use over the last couple of years. I use this this phone with mint moble and I have been very happy with the quality of service and calls from both mint moble and my phone. I have yet to drop a call or not have service where I expect to. I picked this phone because it was the least expensive iPhone with 5g and most of the time I do have 5g strength of service so that has been great.","R45TCWC43TX7U",,,,,,,,,,"2","Great phone so far","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R45TCWC43TX7U","Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2023","31456","1226",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Purple, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PP5MSVB","Size","128GB","Color","Purple","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

Was able to add my old number to the phone (...using tips from Apple Tech Support); then erase all existing Apps & Data on the iPhone 12 (...except for the eSIM!) & then upload my Apps & Data from my old phone using iCloud Backup. Had to log in and re-establish 2FA with a few of the Apps, but no major issues with that, and was back in business! Only annoying aspect was that the supplied charger cable stopped working after a day, but I had plenty others laying around. Overall, a very gratifying experience, and now I have 5G access. Tip: If you utilize 2FA for some of your Apps; if they permit, set up the option of BOTH a phone number & an email...from laptop, in case you lose your phone.","R22406JQ8K34P8",,,,,,,,,,"4","Phone Excellent - Cheap Cable NSG","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22406JQ8K34P8","Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2024","31456","1226",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Black, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PP5MSVB","Size","128GB","Color","Black","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

No scratches. Looks new. Battery charges to 100% Audio is subpar compared to the Ultra, not as loud and quality not as good. I don't like the lightning port. Wish it was the same as my S24 Ultra. In my case I could not get the Hotspot to work. However I did not take it to ATT to see if they could get it to work. That's not why I bought this phone. Amazon has a relatively new gps wrist band tracker that has no monthly fee and it only works with the iPhone. It does not work with Android and I need it to keep tabs on my friend with dementia. So far it works great. It's better than having to pay as much as $50 a month like some trackers on Amazon. So far I'm happy with the iPhone. It's a keeper and can also serve as a backup phone.

So, overall I am happy with this purchase. But I still wanted to review the imperfections so people know what to expect. I’ve been using this phone for 3 months and it was listed as in “very good” condition. I have no complaints about functionality. It functions properly. The battery life is a little less than ideal, but isn’t bad enough to be a problem. The thing that I was most disappointed with, I didn’t notice right away because this phone came with a screen protector on it. It had some air bubbles behind it, and as much as I hate not having a perfect looking screen, I decided to save money and use it for a while before I bought a new screen protector. However when I removed the screen protector the first time I saw that the iPhone screen was very scratched all around the edges. But what bothers me most is that new screen protectors don’t adhere properly to this phone. There are always air bubbles under my screen protector.

I didn’t want to drop close to $1K on a new phone but still wanted to upgrade from my much older previous phone. My iPhone 12 arrived within a few business days. My only complaints are that the third party charger that was sent along did not work, but thankfully I already had several iPhone compatible chargers in my home. The battery health is at 80% but I expected about that much as it is a used device. So far a full charge with moderate use (listening to music, checking social media and texts) lasts me a whole workday anyways. Besides, even getting a new battery eventually would still be a lot cheaper than buying new from Apple and I felt really confident in Amazon to give me a refund in the event the phone was not in working order. Thankfully, everything functions fantastic! I ordered a T-mobile locked one and then just swapped over my SIM, and it updated on my plan immediately to reflect the new phone. Overall I would absolutely buy from Amazon renewed again!","R1E6NRWWSB4HB1",,,,,,,,,,"11","Great value, shipped fast!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1E6NRWWSB4HB1","Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2023","31456","1226",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: White, Service Provider: T-Mobile, Product grade: Renewed","B08PP5MSVB","Size","128GB","Color","White","Service Provider","T-Mobile","Product grade","Renewed"

Externally, looks brand new. Previous owner had a case on it probably at all times. The screen was perfect, no scratches or blemishes. The battery however, is at 77% health. Details on the product page state all phones will have battery health of 80% or better. So that is false. While only 3% from being true, it is also only 2% away from 75%, with a quarter of battery life used. Guess it depends on how one looks at it. Either way, its not 80%. That was a big sales point for myself, as this phone was intended to be a gift for one of my sons, who is currently having issues with his current battery in his current older model iPhone. So really, the last thing i want to do is give him yet another phone with an aged battery. Cosmetics are not important to my son as his phone always has a case on it. I knew the risk i was taking in believing ANYTHING a seller promised, and purchasing sight unseen. So i gambled and lost. Now i will take phone to Best Buy, and pay an additional $89 + for a new Apple battery installation.

Functionality is solid, the camera is excellent, and the shipping was fast, it arrived earlier than expected.","R1HGV32U2EXMH0","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51D2xUMbU+L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51WsjLPETuL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51zqyuN79hL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/612zCZqYxQL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61b8vU81igL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61hgEbKUYRL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61mS6S16fTL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61qvITRjeNL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61w1VBhep+L._SY88.jpg","34","Good value for the price","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1HGV32U2EXMH0","Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2025","31456","1226",,,"Size: 64GB, Color: Black, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PP5MSVB","Size","64GB","Color","Black","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

I checked out all the lenses, flash, speakers and everything else, but I forgot to make a phone call because I had to go to att and get a new sim since I was transferring from a 6s +. The headphone speaker was messed up as I found out like 9 days later when I could only talk on speaker during calls. Battery health was at 82% but it EASILY lasts a full day plus, even with heavy use. I ordered a new one before I sent the first one back and there were a few scratches on the top right, but my case covers it up now. Phone had no issues besides a little dust/dirt in the speaker and mic holes, but you can use a wooden toothpicks to gently clean those out. Got everything switched over and sent the other phone back. Battery health on this one was 88%. Overall, purchase was great - just make sure to double-check everything before the 90 days is up so you can replace it if needed. It feels better in my hand with a case and I added a glass screen protector. CHECKLIST: Proximity sensor while on a call, open up a white board website and make sure the whole screen functions correctly by coloring every inch, ear speaker and bottom speaker, mic, connectivity to your phone service and to your wireless, silent/sound rocker on the left side halfway up, make sure all the buttons press in cleanly and make sure there, check the flash by using flashlight or taking photos and be sure to shine a light on the camera lenses to make sure there are no scratches. Front facing and the two back cameras .... Overall great purchase.","R2Q185U5V6OAPB",,,,,,,,,,"51","First one had an issue, but second one worked fine.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2Q185U5V6OAPB","Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2022","31456","1226",,,"Size: 64GB, Color: Black, Service Provider: Unlocked, Product grade: Renewed","B08PP5MSVB","Size","64GB","Color","Black","Service Provider","Unlocked","Product grade","Renewed"

It did not have a single scratch. Battery life came with 92%, the only thing is that sometimes when I’m on a call with someone, signals cuts off but it happens when I’m outside my house. I’m still testing the phone to figure out if it’s a problem the phone has or it’s just me not having good signal but so far that’s the only thing I’m still testing so that’s the only why I gave it a 4 out of 5 but other than that I’m impressed and happy with the phone.

I needed a phone so bad and bought this one. The battery drains rapidly everyday. That was one of the reasons for replacing the phone. With that said, the phone was delivered so rapidly and even got a Saturday delivery into a rural location. Now that's service. The phone is clean and shiny. It does more than my old iPhone, its larger and doesn't fit my hand so well, but I'm getting used to it finally. I love that it has more features than my old iPhone. After much research, I learned this phones battery just drains rapidly. The reviews online are plenty.
