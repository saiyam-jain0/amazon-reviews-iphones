I recieved just what I asked for, iPhone 13 with 256 GB storage in the color Pink. The phone came in great condition, no dents, scrapes or anything like that, just a few normal wear scratches on the screen, but very very small and minor. Cameras work fantastic, I have no issues with glitches and the provided charging cable worked 100%! The only few complaints I have are: I did pay for excellent and got a maximum capacity of 81% battery, I would expect a higher number for the condition I payed for; Also, under the 'what you'll get' list says that I should've gotten the SIM removal tool and I did NOT get one. And lastly, there are some areas that have what looks like dirt specks in small crevices, nothing too major and you can't really see it unless you're 10 inches or closer. Charging port also looks a bit dirty but it charged fine and fast with the cable provided. Final grading: 9.3/10, would buy again! Although there were a few let downs like Battery MC and missing the SIM tool, the value for the item in its condition is absolutely worth it. *** UPDATE *** It's been 10 days since I got it and Battery Health has already declined New rating: 7/10 Still a good offer, but deffo not the best","RENTTVMR7UJ3U","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61YrQdpyewL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61b0VtFhvWL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ddUYWuPpL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71pnFCky-iL._SY88.jpg",,"119","Love love love!

There is always a risk with a refurbished phone but I've bought almost of my phones this way as I am not so into having the latest gadgets. This is the first such incident. I was issued a refund and the phone is now enroute to be returned. It wouldn't have been such a hassle had it not disabled my old SIM (which is part of the process so as not to clone a SIM).

Funciona correctamente, la batería marca 100% de salud, y no he tenido fallos de rendimiento hasta ahora. Sin embargo, al revisar el sistema, me encontré con que la batería y la pantalla aparecen como “piezas desconocidas”, lo que indica que fueron reemplazadas por partes que no están certificadas por Apple. Esto no se mencionaba en la descripción del producto, y considero que es un detalle importante que debió ser informado con transparencia antes de la compra. Entiendo que al ser un producto reacondicionado puede tener piezas nuevas, pero esperaba al menos saberlo de antemano. Eso afecta la percepción de confianza sobre la calidad de la reparación y el valor del producto. En resumen: • Lo bueno: Estética impecable, buen funcionamiento, sin daños visibles. • Lo negativo: Piezas no originales no informadas, lo cual puede afectar la durabilidad y cobertura de garantía. Recomiendo el producto solo si el comprador está al tanto de estos detalles y no le molestan las piezas no originales.

The others are only visible if I flash a light onto my phone while it's turned off. The phone runs very smooth compared to my iPhone 7, and has an 87% on battery health. My only issue with this is the item was delayed multiple times. I was told it was to be delivered on Saturday but for whatever reason it wasn't and I was home all day. On that same day I called them, I am told it was to be picked up at my local CVS, so I went there, just for them to tell me, they don't have it until Monday. So I went back home, waited a few days, and on Monday morning I recieve a text telling me the package is ready for pick-up at CVS, so I went and it still wasn't there. They told me to come back in on the afternoon, and I did. After 3 different occasions of being told to come in, I explained my situation to the seller and they offered me just a small $10 for compensation... I finally got the product today on Tuesday when they told me to come in this morning. It should never be this difficult to communicate with a customer in my opinion, but it is what it is.

We returned it and tried them a 2nd time. The 2nd phone seems a decent deal. For the first phone (iPhone 13) we received: The battery life on the renewed phone was fairly good - at 94% of original capacity. This had been an issue with phones from this vendor per other reviews but was not an issue with ours. However, this renewed phone had a non-Apple replacement screen that was noticeably low in quality - grainy, with colors dulled, and it cut off part of the display area. Touch responsiveness was bad. Given Amazon pledge that the product was ""professionally inspected and tested by Amazon-qualified supplier,"" I feel the substandard screen should have been spotted and the lower quality disclosed. My family member and my time were wasted by this attempt to pass off a lower quality solution. Return process was easy, although it did require a trip to the UPS store. For the second, replacement (iPhone 13) phone: The replacement for the returned 1st phone arrived quickly. The battery life seems great (100% of original capacity). The screen this time is MUCH better than the low quality screen on the original phone. The case has some scratches and a dent on the ring surrounding one of the camera lenses, but the lens seems unaffected. All in all, a fair price for used phone.

But when I got it I was a little upset. For a few reasons: 1. The phone just came in a bubble wrap pouch and then in a box and in the shipping bag. So a little sketchy on the packaging part but I guess not a huge deal (it did come with a charger and block. Not the official apple one but still good) 2.There were minor cracks at the top of the screen and the charging hole is a little scratched 3.It was kinda just dirty. The back camera had some stuff around it same with the speakers. Not hard to clean it but just work I didn’t want to put into a new (ish) phone lol 4.It took me over 2 hours to get it set up. It needed to be updated but after a little over a hour of it trying to update I gave up and restarted the whole process. It worked the second time but the phone got so hot from doing all this. I decided to just keep it for a bit and see if it’ll have any issues (it’s only been a day ) but no issues (yet ?). I also realized that the chips were just a screen protector so that’s good.So kinda a rough start but so far I’m liking it.","R31D4WQIVJLIXF",,,,,,"4","Frustrated @ first but I think we good","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31D4WQIVJLIXF","Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2024","18003","517",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Midnight, Size: 128GB","B09LNW3CY2","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Midnight","Size","128GB"

De la nada me salta un cartel de “Charging not available” y mi celular nunca estuvo expuesto a lugares con agua o humedad. De hecho siempre que me baño, NUNCA dejo el celular en el baño. Esto me apareció al segundo día que usé el celular nuevo. Es raro, debe ser una falla del sensor. Después dejo de aparecer y el celular me cargo bien pero cada tanto me tira el cartel. A raíz de esto, me compré un cargador inalámbrico y esta todo Ok. Igual con el cargador de cable también me anda pero de la nada pira y tira ese cartel, pasa cuando paso cerca de un baño que quizás alguien se bañó, pero es raro. Lo peor de todo es que lo compré refurbished pero en excelente condiciones. Esto no debería pasar. Ademas vivo en Argentina y no estoy en USA para poder arreglarlo o quejarme con Amazon.

Luckily my mum liked the colour of the phone and bought it off me so I didn’t have to go through the hassle of returning it, but I had to order a different phone so I’m without a phone for nearly two weeks longer than expected. Colour aside, I ordered the excellent quality and it’s appearance was as promised with no visible damage to the exterior of the phone. The battery life was at 90% and charged quickly and seems to hold its charge for a good amount of time. It’s fairly easy to use, though the touch screen wasn’t perfectly responsive (though in my experience no iPhones are). Didn’t seem to generate heat while being used which was a big issue with some of the iPhones. Overall good value for the money but I can’t say that the wrong colour and how long it took to arrive didn’t rub me the wrong way.","R2IFOU2FL1XHQJ","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51hCol7oB6L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ZXIfqkwqL._SY88.jpg",,,,"4","Good phone but not what I ordered","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2IFOU2FL1XHQJ","Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2024","18003","517",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Starlight, Size: 128GB","B09LNW3CY2","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Starlight","Size","128GB"

The issue I have with my phone is the battery. I received a notification that the battery is not an “Apple verified” battery, which I didn’t think was a problem. However, the battery drains really quickly and only lasts about 3 hours. I am also experiencing overheating issues. Like, the phone easily gets hot, but that could also be a battery-related issue. I’m going to get the battery replaced, but otherwise every other aspect of the phone is perfect and working well! Update: In order to get the battery replaced, I had to get the display replaced as well, as it wasn't a genuine apple display. That costed around $400 at the Apple Store. So, in my opinion, it's safer to get the phone straight from apple and spend a bit more money.","R1B9YDXZ7VRZB8","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51a0ri48AhL._SY88.jpg",,,,,"7","Amazing phone!

Also the screen was slightly lifted which you can view from looking at it from the bottom of the phone. This caused it to make a light ""popping"" sound when pressed. The back glass was even worse which is why it probably cracked so easy. There was still some sort of adhesive being used but it wasn't seated fully and the metal rings around the camera which aren't part of the glass back assembly had some small barely visible scratches. This let me know it was a broken device that was repaired. Poorly at that. If the device isn't using OEM parts or the original parts that came with the original phone, they should not be labeled EXCELLENT condition. Thankfully the customer service was good so they did say they will refund me within 3 business days. All I have left to say is buyer beware. I'm sure there's some solid phones here but you can never be really sure. Return it asap if you suspect something isn't quite right.","R2Z3HNTO9HC91W",,,,,,,"It's a crapshoot","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2Z3HNTO9HC91W","Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2025","18003","429",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Blue, Size: 128GB","B09LNW3CY2","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Blue","Size","128GB"

Having read previous reviews about persons receiving phones with a battery health in the 90’s I had no hesitation in purchasing the phone. Well, I was not so lucky. My phone had a battery health of 83%. By mid afternoon I have to recharge this phone (the irony is that I bought this phone because my previous phone needed to be constantly charged during the day) My question to you Amazon is: Don't you think there should be a standardized minimum battery health at which a Premium refurbished phone is sold? For example a premium refurbished iPhone should have a battery life not less than 90% a refurbished phone not less than 80% etc? That way it would not be the luck of the draw when purchasing these phones. I would know that I am getting what I paid for. I certainly would not have paid all this money for a phone which I have to keep hooked up to the charger for life support.","RN632UKI3ZLQA",,,,,,,"It’s the luck of the draw.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RN632UKI3ZLQA","Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2025","18003","429",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Blue, Size: 128GB","B09LNW3CY2","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Blue","Size","128GB"

I am constantly having to go back and fix errors since keys aren’t being registered and the autocorrect is useless. I typed this way on my previous iPhone and did not have this many issues. My previous iPhone was purchased new, so it for sure had an iPhone screen. The problems have gotten worse the longer I’ve had it. Often times when the phone is “asleep,” it will not register me tapping on the screen to wake it up. I have to tap several times and moved the phone around for it to wake up.

When I first opened the box, I noticed it was in excellent physical condition. Almost perfect. I definitely had high hopes for this phone from the get go. Unfortunately, I immediately started having issues once I connected it. It started freezing, I couldn't access my settings or voicemail, and my battery life was already at 85%. I restarted the phone and it worked for about 30 minutes before I started having issues again. While on the charger, at about 90% charged, it turned off on me a twice while I was using it. It didn't automatically turn back on so I had to turn it on again both times. I figured that wasn't a huge problem and would contact Amazon customer service in the morning if it did it again however I started having more problems. Had to make a quick trip to the store and thats when I noticed that as soon as I got in the car and was no longer connected to wifi, it immediately just went to ""No Service"". I would restart it and when it turned on, it would work for a about 3-5 minutes but then would go back to ""No Service"". Fortunately, I knew where I was if not I definitely would have been lost at night. After I got home, I restarted a couple more times but it wouldn't connect to my cellular data anymore or work t all unless I was connected to WIFI. As I stated previously, I had high hopes. Unfortunately, looks like I got a defective phone but I can't risk or deal with the chance of getting another refurbished phone with problems so I decided to go and ahead and return the phone. I literally had to run to to Best Buy 15 minutes before they closed to buy a new phone because unfortunately in this day and age, you can't be without a phone. Hopefully this is a good alternative for someone else, but I did not get that lucky.","R1DL30GGHB3SK2",,,,,,"4","Had High Hopes","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1DL30GGHB3SK2","Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2024","18003","429",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Midnight, Size: 128GB","B09LNW3CY2","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Midnight","Size","128GB"

The battery sucked and the battery health had deteriorated to 78%. That means when you charge it to 100% it’s really only charged up to 78%. In the settings under battery health Apple said battery was critical and needed to be replaced for $89 Why would I replace a battery when the phone was supposed to be in excellent condition according to the seller. That should include the software too!!!!!!! So no I think the seller doesn’t care because all of the iPhone should have been excellent. Not just the way it looks. Paid $307. Why would I pay another $89 which would make the iPhone $396. So basically $400. A new unlocked iPhone 13 128GB at Best Buy is 549.00. I’d rather buy a new one with no problems at all.

Two things: Immediately upon unboxing the phone, I noticed it was dirty. Like, gunk caked on the sides where the buttons are and on the bottom where the speaker/charger port is. It looks like someone took someone’s phone out of its case after prolonged use and just put it in the box. Secondly, as SOON as I started using the phone, I noticed that I could only hear calls via speakerphone. The other person could hear me just fine, but I couldnt hear them through the internal ear piece speaker next to the front camera. After countless google searches, trouble shooting forums, hours cleaning out my speakers with isopropyl alcohol, resetting my network features, you name it. It turns out it is NOT a software bug, and the phone itself is defective. The sound from the internal speaker is either muted completely (no audio) or its extremely distorted, crackling, sounds like terrible radio static, etc. The only thing that seems to fix it (temporarily, i have to do this several times a day) is by pressing down on the screen a few inches under the front camera. And even then I have to play a guessing game with where and how hard to push! Amazon has this product listed as ‘inspected, tested, and refurbished as necessary to be fully functional according to Amazon Renewes Standards.” No one even made sure the phone I received was CLEAN, let alone functioning properly. I could've had the same experience, taking a hand me down phone from a friend or family member, and probably wouldnt have had to pay hundreds of dollars for it. A partial refund would be nice, considering I was quoted $100 to fix the speaker on a phone that was already supposed to be fixed, but I dont have much hope. My other phone was in far worse shape and I technically cant use it, or else I would return this altogether.","R3UPJSWGIY5LTI","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618Vs05wcfL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61EdF2SgvfL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61fBAkfqmGL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61faidGtGjL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61tnUlWhI1L._SY88.jpg","4","Came Dirty, with Malfunctioning internal speaker","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UPJSWGIY5LTI","Reviewed in the United States on May 8, 2024","18003","429",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Pink, Size: 256GB","B09LNW3CY2","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Pink","Size","256GB"

I purchased the best (more expensive) option. Phone came a little dinged up, which I expected. But the problem is the charging port is going bad. When plugged in phone will go from charging to not charging. Can’t use phone while plugged into cord without the charging going in and out which is quite annoying. Phone only reaches 81% charging capacity. I’m quite disappointed actually. The screen on the phone came in really good shape but the rest definitely came scratched up.

They will not be noticeable unless I am looking for them under bright light. I tested the phone for a few days and all of the functionalities work so far, but the phone's battery maximum capacity is only at 80%, so it is basically a phone with a dead battery. The phone will drain from 100% to 30% in less than 2 hours and I didn't do heavy gaming or play video in bright setting, so it is unusable on the go unless I carry a portable charger the entire time. The price I paid is reasonable for a 3-yr old iphone model, but I expect at least one year of normal service life out of it. Hope the return process is as easy as purchasing.

I started using it a lot for work so I wanted something with a bigger battery life. Still not being a True Believer it led me to the next logical step of the iPhone 13 which I bought a renewed version from Amazon here. It is absolutely flawless. I am not able to determine the difference between this an open box or brand new. I see some bad reviews for renewed, maybe I'm just one of the lucky ones, but this phone out of the box looks brand new functions like new, but only shows 80% battery life....the software says it is genuine and replaced....but only 80%. Stil this phone rocks. I would recommend it to anybody.

Delivery was extremely fast - the phone was on my porch about 14 hours after placing the delivery - mind boggling, so take this into account if you need a cheap phone very quickly. I ultimately decided to buy a new phone on contract via T-Mobile and Costco, which ended up being the same price as this one, so I returned the phone. Returning this phone to the seller was hassle free and the full amount was credited back to my Amazon account.

First, shipping was very fast! I had the phone in my hands within 48 hours of placing the order, which surpassed all my expectations. It came with a charger (both the cable and block). The phone was dead when it arrived, so I needed to charge it first, but no big deal. The first thing I noticed was that there are some small chips and scratches around the edges of the device, most noticeable on the top, but with a case on, the damage will barely be visible. I've been using it without a case the last couple of days while waiting for the one I ordered to arrive, and even uncovered, it doesn't look that bad. Screen and cameras are in perfect condition. The phone was perfectly clean on arrival too, no dirt or dust. The max battery capacity is 85%. Since I paid for excellent quality, this was a bit disappointing to me and is the reason for me rating only 4 stars, especially after seeing other reviews of people who got batteries in the 90s, but it's still a major upgrade over what I had before (a 2020 SE with only 72% capacity). Overall, I've been happy with the performance so far, especially for the price. I would buy from MobileSupply again!","R1KTLVOOL7K15V",,,,,,"33","Very good for the price","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KTLVOOL7K15V","Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2024","18003","888",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Pink, Size: 256GB","B09LNW3CY2","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Pink","Size","256GB"

The battery reports 100%, and overall the phone is in good condition. If you keep your phone in a case, you wouldn't notice the small gouge on the top right. There is additional minor wear and tear around the metal housing (seems like the prior user didn't use a case). If you prefer to go caseless, expect that you could receive a device with some minor but noticeable wear and tear. However, the phone was not sold as ""flawless"" so some wear and tear is to be expected. For my use case, the phone met my needs. I threw it in a case and don't notice the flaws The phone came with a glass screen protector which was a nice touch. I haven't pulled off the screen protector to see if the underlying screen has scratches. if there is wear-and-tear on the screen (ex. small scratches from keys, etc.) they are minimal and not noticeable thought the screen protector. Overall satisfied with this purchase for my use case.","R1SHGI8Y9XSX3R","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51impeES5SL._SY88.jpg",,,,,"17","Phone is in good condition with (1) noticeable scratch in the top.

The product information says the phone should have been well cleaned, the screen has no scratches, and the body shows light scratches barely visible from 12 inches away. The phone was dirty with visible grime that my cursory wipe with an electronics swab easily picked up, it was clearly not cleaned. The phone body was more than a little scratched. It looks like it got swiped hard on the right facing edge on concrete. You can see the exposed aluminum from far away as the color difference is noticeable from the blue color I got. This is not a big deal to me as it's going to be in a case that would hopefully cover that. The screen has clearly been replaced. The screen also has a pressure glare in the upper section that is visible with some backgrounds. The screen being replaced is annoying as the notification for an unknown part can't be dismissed, so you always have a red notification visible when you look at the settings icon. Overall I would not gift it to others but for the price in comparison to other places was still good. It was also missing the charging block that the info said it was supposed to include along with the cable. I knew that I might not get the best when I opted for a ""good"" phone over an ""excellent"" condition one. Maybe I should have just spend the extra $44 dollars and got the excellent condition one. For now I am content with my purchase as most of my complaints are ""cosmetic"" issues for me.","R3NNM3LC5E5JR",,,,,,"36","""Good"" Condition","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NNM3LC5E5JR","Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2023","18003","888",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Blue, Size: 128GB","B09LNW3CY2","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Blue","Size","128GB"

I bought several renewed iphone 13s but had to return one after another. I paid for phones in excellent condition but it is clear they are minimally inspected or, in some cases, fraudulently sold in the wrong category. Issues include: 1. Several had significant screen scratches, some attempted to hide issues behind new screen protectors 2. Replaced screens not original quality with significant lag and sensitivity problems 3. Lots that were still associated with old accounts 4. One had a defective charging port But the final straw came with one scratched phone that I decided to keep because it seemed less scratched than others. Sadly, I was very, very wrong. Just a couple of weeks after the 3 month return period the phone just died. Took it in to an Apple store and they spotted the issue in few seconds. They pointed out condensation in the camera lens that proved that the phone had been seriously and irreparably water damaged before I bought it. My untrained eye failed to recognize this issue, but clearly it should have been caught by the ""professional inspection"" that the Renewed program is supposed to provide. More likely the seller knew all about it all along and fraudulently misrepresented the phone as ""Renewed."" Attempts to contact the seller and/or Amazon to make this right have gone nowhere.

At that point, it would not connect to data whatsoever. The phone line was useless, and texting was useless. We went for several weeks without being able to communicate with our teenage daughter. We called T-Mobile and experienced multiple 1+ hour calls with them while they tried to figure out what was wrong. We were told twice that they would unlock the phone within 7—10 days. We waited those out. Then finally they came back with the answer that the previous account holder of the phone had stopped paying for it, and they locked the device. That’s when I went back to Synergy, the Amazon marketplace seller, and told them what happened. They quickly authorized the return and promised a refund upon receipt of the phone. I sent it back via UPS as per their instructions, and it arrived at their address in Brooklyn at 4:43p.m. on December 10, 2024. I waited a few days to allow them time to issue the refund, but it never came. So then I chatted with them again, and they said that since they didn’t issue a refund within two days, we would need to let Amazon know so that Amazon could issue the refund. I requested a call from Amazon, and a rep named Ronaldo called me to discuss the issue. Ronaldo said that it was outside the timeframe where Amazon could issue a refund and that I would need to dispute the transaction with my bank. I explained the situation to Ronaldo and that we were within the return window when this whole return/refund issue was started but that I had to allow time for the item to be sent back and for the seller to issue the refund before I could go to Amazon for help. They didn’t care and stood by their “not within the timeframe” stance. That left us without a phone and without almost $400. Stay away from this seller. STAY AWAY.","R320P9T7P90IMB",,,,,,"20","DO NOT BUY","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R320P9T7P90IMB","Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2025","18003","1405",,,"Service Provider: T-Mobile, Color: Blue, Size: 128GB","B09LNW3CY2","Service Provider","T-Mobile","Color","Blue","Size","128GB"

I had to hold the screen together by using clear tape on the sides of the phone. Then on the first of June my phone started to turn off out of nowhere and then turn back on by itself. I would charge it thinking it was dead but as soon as I would put it on the charger it would turn on and then it would turn off again and it would repeat this until it stopped. I would even charge it all the way to 100% and it would go to 7% or even “die” out of nowhere when not on the charger. I immediately got tired of trying to even use this phone and it has barely been 2 months of even having it. I am severely upset at the fact that I have wasted my money for nothing.

Unfortunately, what I received has been nothing but a headache. By March, the phone started giving my daughter problems, and that's when the real nightmare began. I contacted the company, explaining the issues and requesting a full refund, which I was entitled to under their policy. Instead of honoring the refund, they offered to fix the phone. I reluctantly agreed, hoping they would make things right. I sent the phone back to them, providing all necessary information, including the passwords they needed to access the device. After what felt like endless back-and-forth, they returned the phone to me, claiming they couldn't access it, even though I had provided all the information they requested. To my frustration, the phone was still not working when I received it back. I couldn't continue dealing with the situation at that time because I had to leave the country. Upon returning, I decided to take the phone to a professional store to see if they could fix it. I visited two different repair shops, and neither could do anything to bring the phone back to life. At this point, it's clear that this company sold me a completely defective product and failed to fix it when given the opportunity. Not only am I out the money I spent on this phone, but I am also stuck with a completely useless iPhone. This company stole my money and neglected to resolve the issue they caused. It's shocking and disappointing that Amazon even allows such companies to sell on their platform. I trusted Amazon to vet the sellers they work with, but clearly, that trust was misplaced. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this company at all costs. They do not stand behind their products, and their customer service is a joke. I'm now left without a phone and with a lot of frustration. SHAME ON THIS COMPANY and SHAME ON AMAZON for letting them operate on their platform!","R2RIELRBO28PUB",,,,,,"92","Beware of This Company!

Woot the seller hide behind the return/refund policy being 90 days and pushed me to Amazon. Amazon wouldn't do anything either. I called/emailed both companies several times. I even took the phone to Apple and they ran diagnostics which indicated the faulty part that was installed when it was refurbished. This is the best part. I received this communication back from Woot and thought they finally were going to help... Unfortunately when I requested the return package they went back to the refund/return policy. It just shows they aren't consistent and don't have their act together. I've purchased my wife a new iphone and will try to sell the faulty one back for some small credit.

If you prefer to return the item for a full refund, you can contact us back so that we can help you with a prepaid return label. I realize that asking you to contact us again would be disappointing. However, we really feel that this is the best way to assist you with this concern. Thank you for understanding, and we appreciate your patience. I hope to hear from you soon.

I waited two days to open it because I was waiting for my screen protector and case I ordered from another place and didn't want to break it in the meantime. When we opened and put on screen protector and case, it would not charge normally. The only way it would charge was if you pulled up on the cord which is not efficient. We purposely bought a refurbished excellent one so that it would be excellent quality. It took a few days for the company to respond to our request for a refund/exchange and within that time frame, over a week will have passed before I can order a new one due to the money being tied up waiting for the refund. We sent back yesterday and hoping it doesn't take much longer. To add to the frustration, we specifically ordered this during Ohio's tax free week so we saved money on tax on this purchase, but because it was not the quality they promised, we asked to exchange it so we could save the money on the tax again. They said they couldn't exchange (even though this company had other phones on here to sell-not like I really wanted to buy from them again anyways due to honesty issues). So we, lost 30-35 dollars because we now have to pay taxes on a different product and the time wasted because my other phone went to crap in the mean time and I was expecting theirs to actually work when we received it.

It turns out that the screen itself was peeling away! Next thing I know, it began crackling and spreading. I’m now trying to return it. A refurbished product should have better quality control. I’m disappointed that the screen is falling apart like this. It has been in a new otterbox since I bought it. So it was NOT a screen protector. When I got this, I was really excited because I needed to upgrade from an old iPhone. This seems to do the trick except that it came with some sort of screen protector that I did not know was on it. As I was putting my OtterBox case onto it, one of the corners of the screen protector suddenly started peeling up and now has an air pocket underneath it at each of the corners. When I try to press the corner back down to get the air pocket out from underneath it, this weird screen protector suddenly cracked and is now spreading across this screen protector. I’m thankful it had a screen protector but the screen protector isn’t doing a good job when itself is peeling away from the screen. Now I’m gonna have to remove the screen protector and replace it with another one. That was a waste of money. The battery life is pretty good. I checked it and they guarantee it to have at least 80% of the original battery life and this came with 84% so that works. The size of the screen is pretty darn good and easier for me to see. There are a lot more features to this 13 model than the word to the seven model which I’ve been using so I am pleased with the Apple iOS.","R28MG7TW6H3PLE",,,,,,"25","It came with a defective screen","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28MG7TW6H3PLE","Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2023","18003","1405",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: (PRODUCT)RED, Size: 256GB","B09LNW3CY2","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","(PRODUCT)RED","Size","256GB"

However, what I can say is an issue follows. On taking the phone out of the box and starting it up, everything went well. Past this point, and well, it went downhill. I took my sim and placed it in the phone prior to setting it up and was met with constant ""searching for signal"". I tried multiple times to reset the phone, take out sim, even tried an esim with my carrier to no avail. After realizing my carrier was unable to assist me (and there was no support option with the seller listed), I went directly to Apple. Apple informed me the phone I had purchased had a failing cellular base band. The product details state the following ""This pre-owned product has been professionally inspected, tested and cleaned by Amazon qualified vendors. It is not certified by Apple."". I understand it may not be certified by Apple, however, if this product was ""professionally inspected, tested, and cleaned by Amazon qualified vendors"", why then did I receive a product which does not work. If Apple support identifies any other issues, I will be returning the phone and I will be expecting a full refund as the product sold does not satisfy their following statement ""The product is refurbished, fully functional, and in excellent condition. Backed by the 90-day Amazon Renewed Guarantee."" Also, as an FYI, the unlocked phone I purchased was initially set up for a carrier and was later unlocked to allow all carriers. Buyers beware. *will update review based on Apple's response to my warranty repair request* UPDATE - Apple completed a warranty repair on the phone and it is working as intended. The phone did come with a limited warranty which covered the repair.","R2HW1KLU9QG2J",,,,,,"54","Phone Turns on...that's about it","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HW1KLU9QG2J","Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2022","18003","1405",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Midnight, Size: 128GB","B09LNW3CY2","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Midnight","Size","128GB"

It works so I’ll live with it— but buyer beware! The unit I received was poor quality. The bottom right of the screen is raised, so the new screen wasn’t set right. The touch screen isn’t set right either, and hits random buttons or just doesn’t respond at all. Then the battery they used wasn’t Apple OEM, so you can’t tell its health— which is a big red flag… this phone dies fairly quickly, so I think it’s a bad battery too. All in all, I feel cheated out of my $ and thinking heavily of returning it. I understand buying such a cheap item would come with COSMETIC damages and scratches, maybe even a 3rd party battery, so I expected a lot— but this one is more than that.

The phone arrived within 5 days and was in fact in a pristine state from an external point of view. However, once I installed an eSIM, I noticed that something was wrong. The phone didn't connect to any carrier and was LOCKED! After some search, I found out that the phone was BLACKLISTED due to FRAUD!!! How can something like this happen on Amazon? I contacted Amazon customer service but they didn't seem to be very interested in my situation, constantly postponing the reimbursement date. Actually, I sent several emails and chatted several times in the live chat and usually associates responded very quickly without thoroughly reading the details of what was actually happening. Only when I started to become really upset with the situation and demanded to talk to a supervisor, a reimbursement for my account was ordered. Overall, I paid the phone itself + a replacement SIM card (installing the eSIM in a blacklisted phone invalidates your SIM) + shipping costs (the seller didn't provide me a paid shipping label). Overall, this was the worst experience that I have ever had on Amazon and I strongly advise everyone who is thinking about buying tech equipment here to look somewhere else first! Once Amazon and the seller have your money, solving the situation is much more complicated.

It was a faulty battery. I knew it was a risk getting a phone that didn’t work so I wasn’t overly upset that it didn’t work out. I didn’t get upset until I returned the phone through UPS and saw that someone named Alberto got the phone back in New York a week ago, but I still never got a refund. I messaged them again and all they said was “ Please allow us additional time to further look into your return” so I say “okay.” (Mind you they already had the phone) three days later and no response nor refund.

We have very touchy carrier coverage in our area, so we thought it was attributed to this. After the issues got worse, we reached out to Apple and they ran a special diagnostic test resulting in issues that they said “come with a bad phone that has not been properly restored.” I reached out to the seller, and they refused to provide any type of support. I then followed up with Amazon, who sent this reply verbatim to me “The A-to-z Guarantee protects buyers when they do not receive an item or an item does not match its description. Although we understand your disappointment, you received the item and the item matched its description.” So I guess because the item matched the description of “iPhone,” they’re covered - who cares if it actually works, right???

Took it to the Apple store to have it checked out and was informed that their were multiple internal issues and would soon stop working altogether. There was only a 3 month return period, but none of these issues occurred before four months after purchased. Seller, Kanga Supply, was contacted but they refused to assist in any way. They were also contacted by Amazon requesting that they supply a return label and refused. Seller would not work with us at all.

When the phone arrived, it seemed normal at first, but once I began setting up the phone I realized the multiple flaws of the phone. First off the screen had been replaced with a lower quality one, with it being very noticeable of how low quality the screen display was. Additionally, once I tried out recording and testing out the audio, I found out that not ONE but TWO out of the three built in microphones that the phone had (bottom and front) were either bad quality or didn't work at all. The bottom microphone didn't even pick up any noise besides static, the front mic was extremely low quality, and I can tell that it's been replaced with some random part that was probably not even meant for the iphone 13. Furthermore, the display was horrendous to use, while texting you can notice the accidental double taps that the display was mis inputing. I really do hope that they see this, I've bought from here before and I didn't have as bad as an experience as this was. Really disappointing considering that the web page claims that everything is fully functional and is in ""excellent"" conditions.","R6LP2G00MKOW4",,,,,,"13","EXTREMELY DISSAPPOINTED","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R6LP2G00MKOW4","Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2024","18003","1405",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Midnight, Size: 128GB","B09LNW3CY2","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Midnight","Size","128GB"

I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt and see if the problem would disappear because returning is such a hassle and I was afraid the seller would have a problem with it. Ultimately, the screen ended up completely falling out and cracked. I returned it about two weeks ago, and the seller messaged me saying that it could not be accepted because it was cracked in my possession. I told them that there were problems with the phone and that the screen fell off clearly due to improper refurbishing.

Once you have paid they tell you “please return item” for total refund but when you are in another country situation is totally different and you may incur in further costs & risks, so you become “ANOTHER VICTIM” of these merchants, with no consequence from Amazon.
