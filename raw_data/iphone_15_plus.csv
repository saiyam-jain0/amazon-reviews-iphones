Only issue is I really wish they had packaged it better . It came in a cardboard fed ex envelope and was packaged inside a long slender box with absolutely nothing to protect it . The box was too big so the phone had been sliding around all in the box and the box was not even taped shut or anything . Very poor packaging . The phone itself seems to be fine and it did come with a new phone charger .

While I like both, one thing I noticed over time is that androids (especially Pixels) improve and add useful features, while iPhones don't change meaningfully. I had this phone blfor about a month before I gave it to my mom. iPhones used to be boring but slightly better than most androids. We're now at the point where high end androids (at least those from Samsung, Google, and OnePlus) are more interesting and better phones. If Apple makes an interesting phone, I'm sure I'll get one. For now, if you're looking at an iPhone 15 or 16, get a 14 or 13.

With that being said I did pay around 200-300 less ,which is a pro , however there is some cons . Cons ; shipping took about 1 week which isn’t long , just long for Amazon . Also phone was refurbished so there was sadly some small knicks on the top of the phone frame but nothing to crazy , screen was almost perfect , had super minor scratches but wouldn’t even be able to see if you cleaned it good and like us had a screen protector , The review that says it wasn’t unlocked is wrong , phone just needed to be brought to Metro or whatever carrier you’re taking it to and they charge 25 plus tax to activate it , Will all that I think those minor inconveniences was worth the 300 dollar discount you get for buying a refurbished phone with Amazon , I hope this review helped .

The phone came in good condition. The phone was unlocked on all carriers so I was able to choose which one I wanted very easily. The phone does heat up pretty fast when I charge it even if it’s only on the charger for 15 mins the phone will automatically stop charging because of the temperature until it drops, so I’m not sure how durable it will be in the future. I can tell this screen was replaced it’s not as vivid as a brand new iPhone but you get what you pay for I guess. It’s a good phone I just wish the screen was calibrated better and also wish the phone didn’t overheat while charging. Other than that as far as how it looks and the description it came exactly how they said it would just some minor issues you may come across. Update less than a month later : I woke up one day and my screen just stopped working, like I can hear people calling me I can feel text vibrating etc but it is completely blacked out and not working. Never dropped the phone or damaged it. It just stopped working one day. This phone was about $670 I believe and brand new it may retail for about $200 or so more. Save yourself the trouble and just get a brand new phone. People work too hard for their money for these types of inconveniences. I would highly recommend to stay away from this buyer and go to an actual phone store. I just put in a request for a refund today as it happened this morning so I will come back with another update on that progress. I had 3 stars at first now I’m changing it to 1. Really sad because I wanted to love this phone as it is so nice looking but the mechanical issues make it impossible for use. Update on return: returning the phone was super easy I got the full refund because I returned phone in the condition it was received and it was less than 90 days since my purchase! I feel sorry for people who have experienced the same issues as me but couldn’t get refunds because it was more than 90 days. But I did end up buying a brand new 16 plus directly from Apple for about $200 more than this used phone so I highly suggest if you have to money to pay for a used phone you can just pay the few extra hundred for a brand new phone that comes with more security should anything go wrong.. hope this helps anyone out there looking..","R6MA9JSJ345VR",,,,,,,,"13","Not worth it.

When I received the phone (day 1) the screen sticks and after researching the way to fix this is resetting the phone. After having to reset it multiple times a day (by day 3) I said I can’t keep doing this. I contacted the seller and they said they’d be happyyyy (exaggerated) to replace it I would have to have to go through Amazon customer service to submit a replacement request. Contacted customer service and they cannot do a replacement request my only option is a refund. Well that would lead me without a phone and now the prices have increased for another. I purchased the insurance so I take it to the repair company. Well that’s going to cost me… why should I pay for an issue that I had no control of. The phone does have a limited warranty, so the guy told me to take it to Apple. I took it to Apple. They run the diagnostic and they said nothing is wrong and that I just needed to updated to the newest IOS. Next day it still sticks. I take it back to Apple and after running a deeper diagnostics I now have to get a full replacement but they do not have the replacement in store and have to order it in. I come back to get the replacement and as he is submitting the service ticket it will not allow him and says the phone has to be sent in and will take them a week. Long story short I’m back to my broken phone and cannot get a new one or this one fixed. This may just be a one off experience and not necessarily on the seller unless they are selling knowingly with these issues, but it’s a frustration one.","R104FVYLFUZO3Q",,,,,,,,"40","A complete headache for me!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R104FVYLFUZO3Q","Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2024","1012","84",,,"Size: 128GB, Color: Pink, Service Provider: T-Mobile, Product grade: Renewed","B0CMT4XDSC","Size","128GB","Color","Pink","Service Provider","T-Mobile","Product grade","Renewed"
