It has issues that didn’t surface until the third month and the return window has closed. There is a lot to love about Android and I am sorry I made this change hoping for the relief from Android woes!!! From the frying pan into the fire! First, I couldn’t figure out how to press numbers when I was called by my friend in prison who had an automated “accept this call press zero…. The numbers would not register. I called Apple and the girl took me all over the phone and this was on the last day of return. The next call from my friend there was NOTHING registering on my keypad again. I almost smashed this phone with a hammer! So I searched YouTube for several hours and found the solution and it was a split screen turned on - in the &@(¥ing factory settings!!!! Thanks Apple! You wasted at least five hours of my time! And there are plenty of people with the same problem. Steve Jobs has to be rolling over in his grave. The speaker pops. The spell check is crap. The ability to move the cursor within a word is crap. The curser floats out of the word and ends up elsewhere. Good luck erasing and retyping. If you misspell a word it often selects the wrong word and the word is WAY off the context of the sentence and how it selects that word is beyond any logical exercise. Are Apple designers and technicians high? Very disappointed. Value for money: Ha ha ha ha ha Sound quality: pops, sometimes high and sometimes low. My $300 Android phone had much better quality of sound, but in fairness this might have something to do with the case I bought. Screen protection: This is refurbished. But at over $800 one would think they would throw in a $0.30 piece of plastic. Phone quality: Not impressed. It appears this phone is BETTER than Android at handling pictures and video. This is the only plus I find. One would think Apple would have a better control of its technology. But the youngsters probably love it for status…. Look at me, I’m cool!","R1TKF48IOE360I",,,,,,,,,"Unimpressive","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1TKF48IOE360I","Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2025","1568","43",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Natural Titanium, Size: 512GB","B0CMZDBVWT","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Natural Titanium","Size","512GB"

I found the camera to be junk. Whenever I would scan my lotto ticket with my camera pointing at the ticket's barcode, it had all kinds of trouble scanning it. The performance of the camera is ridiculous. It even takes blurry pictures. But I ended up keeping and using the iPhone for 6 months, to try to give it time to grow on me. But facts are facts, and I could not deny any longer that the camera is terrible and the phone was way overpriced. Boy, was I a fool. I ended up selling it and getting a Samsung 23FE which scans barcodes in lightening speed with no issues. The camera functions better as well, and it is much cheaper. But one other thing about the iPhone that drove me nuts was the flipping up of an open page to close it. One flip up made it disappear out of sight, but does not make the application close. You have to flip it up a few times to actually close an open app, whereas the Samsung has a ""close all"" icon that pops up which really closes all the open apps, and does it the first time.","R2XZ5JQZW8FIYJ",,,,,,,,,"I went back to Samsung","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2XZ5JQZW8FIYJ","Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2024","1568","43",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Blue Titanium, Size: 256GB","B0CMZDBVWT","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Blue Titanium","Size","256GB"

I found by accident that if I rotate it clockwise it will stay on Photo instead of switching to Movie. I did not have this problem with my iPhone 12 Pro Max. This phone is otherwise great.

The phone arrived in an aftermarket box with a third-party charger, which I expected and had no issue with. The phone itself had small scratches and noticeable wear on the casing, which was disappointing but understandable for a renewed product at a discounted price. The battery life is decent. I ran a battery health check upon receiving it and found it had around 250 charging cycles, which was more than I expected given the release date. That said, after four months of use, the battery has held up well and hasn’t been a concern. Performance-wise, the phone is fast, responsive, and everything I expected from the 15 Pro Max. I love the USB-C charging and having access to the new Apple AI features, which makes the experience even better. Overall, this is a great option if you’re okay with some wear and tear. It offers solid performance at a more reasonable price, but just manage your expectations regarding the cosmetic condition.","RKAIHDZMKBMR9",,,,,,,,"20","Solid Performance for a Renewed Device, but Expect Signs of Wear","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RKAIHDZMKBMR9","Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2025","1568","59",,,"Service Provider: T-Mobile, Color: Blue Titanium, Size: 256GB","B0CMZDBVWT","Service Provider","T-Mobile","Color","Blue Titanium","Size","256GB"

But, when I tried to get this phone activated, my phone carrier said this phone was still locked, even though on here, it says it’s unlocked. And I had a hard time getting my eSIM cut on, so that was a hassle. And then, the battery health is on 89%.

Although it is ""renewed"", the iPhone has no noticeable physical imperfections, dings or scratches. As mentioned in another review, we also observed upon wireless carrier setup, this phone typically has 2 out of 4 bars signal strength in contrast to Samsung 4 out of 5 signal bars placed in the identical indoor locations with antennae facing identical local tower direction(s). It behaves like most modern MacOS systems (w/a few more extra steps to accomplish some tasks). We prefer fingerprint vs facial unlock similar to iPad/MacBooks and available external storage (micro-SD card), so those features are dearly missed. “Move to iOS"" (GooglePlayStore app) made 99% of the Android data/file(s) transfer relatively seamless, however, a few transferred contacts didn't have all ""Note"" details retained and had to be manually updated. ""Samsung Notes"" also had to be manually copy/pasted into Apple Notes along with Timers/Alarms having to be manually recreated. The final hurdle was the search for an app/program to convert/transfer our preferred ringtones files (i.e. "".mp3"", "".wav"", etc.) to Mac-specific "".m4r"" audio files which we found in Audacity (Apple forces one to add/access/remove audio files ONLY via iTunes). We experienced no issues connecting our Apple Watch, AirPods & even our Samsung Galaxy Buds+ via Bluetooth to this phone. Battery usage under the same daily routines of the Samsung S23Ultra appears to be about the same on average (2-4 days until observing15%-20% battery remaining). Because mobile phones cost as much as laptops these days, we always choose to apply tempered glass screen/lens protectors along w/obtaining full coverage cases for those times when ""life interrupts"". Two weeks into ownership, the navigational iQuirks are less cumbersome and the bouncing back & forth b/t Apple/Android is becoming more intuitive. Overall we expect this renewed item via Amazon to serve us as well as our previous ""Renewed"" Samsung S20Ultra & aforementioned S23Ultra.

I am satisfied with the battery health at 100% 84 Cycles. Although I don’t feel this was worth the price, if your spending around 1k for this for excellent quality, i expect it to be near flawless. I had high expectations but I guess you just have to be lucky with what you get.","R1YH9JE4C3WMCF",,,,,,,,"10","Dissatisfied","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YH9JE4C3WMCF","Reviewed in the United States on September 20, 2024","1568","66",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Natural Titanium, Size: 256GB","B0CMZDBVWT","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Natural Titanium","Size","256GB"

I’ll list the pros and cons below. Pros: 98% battery No scratches on screen Cons: Scratches and chips around camera rings and body. Phone is glitchy. My apple carplay freezes every time I connect it to my car and I’m experiencing multiple app crashes and sometimes the phone randomly mute all audio and I have to restart the phone. I also was on a video call yesterday and the phone randomly restarted which was really weird I did ask multiple of my friends that have this phone if they’re having these issues and they also said no, which makes me wonder if this is an hardware issue vs a software. I will give the phone a couple more weeks and if nothing changes I will have to return it.","R1CXD70XCS9D0Z",,,,,,,,"3","Physical Condition Is Ok But Weird Stuff are Happening","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CXD70XCS9D0Z","Reviewed in Canada on September 21, 2024","1568","66",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Black Titanium, Size: 512GB","B0CMZDBVWT","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Black Titanium","Size","512GB"

I bought this phone based on the description that it was “excellent refurbished” condition, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. Here’s why I’m giving this a 1-star rating: 1. Overheating Issues: The phone gets hot very quickly during basic use, even when just browsing or texting. It’s uncomfortable to hold and concerning for long-term use. 2. Battery Life is Terrible: Despite the description claiming the battery was at 98%, the phone drains ridiculously fast. I can barely make it through a few hours before needing to charge again. For a phone advertised as “excellent,” this is unacceptable. 3. Scuffed Camera: The camera has visible scuffs on it, making it seem like no effort was made to refurbish or inspect the phone properly before selling it. 4. Battery Cycles Misleading: The phone already had 128 cycles, which isn’t what I would expect from a battery advertised as nearly new. This level of wear should have been disclosed upfront. 5. Stuck Without Options: I can’t go without a phone, so now I’m stuck with a subpar device in a predicament I didn’t sign up for. This was supposed to be a reliable, refurbished phone, but it feels like I’ve been sold something far from “excellent.” I’m very disappointed with this purchase and would strongly recommend others avoid this seller. If I had the option, I would return this immediately.","R3PZJAWGQPGL2A",,,,,,,,"146","Definitely regret this purchase…","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PZJAWGQPGL2A","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024","1568","210",,,"Service Provider: AT&amp;T, Color: Natural Titanium, Size: 256GB","B0CMZDBVWT","Service Provider","AT&amp;T","Color","Natural Titanium","Size","256GB"

Most companies, Amazon included, sends the replacement so that you don’t go without and you ship the defective item back or get charged again. Obviously I don’t have another phone to transfer my data and use while I wait for them to correct this issue that should’ve never made it past their “inspection”.

Because the phone was a gift, they refused to take responsibility - even though the issue was clear. Returning the phone was also problematic due to my location.

Unfortunately, my experience was anything but excellent. The phone arrived with the screen already loose, which was concerning, but things got even worse—within less than five minutes of use, the screen completely stopped working. I was shocked that a product described as being in such good condition could arrive in this state. To make matters worse, the refund process has been painfully slow. Amazon’s customer support has been unhelpful, with constant delays and no real urgency in resolving the issue. I expected much better service from a company of this size, especially when dealing with such an expensive product. If you're considering buying a refurbished or ""excellent condition"" device from Amazon, think twice. This has been a frustrating and disappointing experience, and I wouldn’t want anyone else to go through the same.","R12CHY5VQR71HG","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Awpyn5VnL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61BcDp0hghL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,"18","Extremely Disappointed – Faulty Device and Terrible Support","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R12CHY5VQR71HG","Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2025","1568","210",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: White Titanium, Size: 256GB","B0CMZDBVWT","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","White Titanium","Size","256GB"

Now, several months later, I’m dealing with an activation lock because the original buyer didn’t settle their account. The phone itself is impressive—great camera quality, smooth performance, and a sleek design. However, that’s overshadowed by the major issue of not being able to use it. I’ve reached out to customer service multiple times, but the resolution process has been frustratingly slow. In short, if you’re considering buying this phone, I strongly advise against it.

Instead Amazon has insisted that we leave it on the front porch (in the rain) and UPS will pick up from my porch in the next 3 days. Will not provide any option but to leave outside in the rain...... and then they will sell a water-damaged, dropped damaged, phone to somebody else.","R3A8NCHJLL79AA",,,,,,,,"5","Very Disappointed.

Back in December, the phone went into SOS mode and never went back out. Apparently it was not paid off and therefore marked STOLEN. THEY ARE SELLING STOLEN PROPERTY!!! And they will give you some bs tips to fix the SOS mode and then tell you to ship it back! I’ve seen some other reviews on here stating that after the phone was shipped back, they never heard from this Merchant again, so i chose to not return it and to take it to an ECOATM to at least get a little bit of what i paid for it..
