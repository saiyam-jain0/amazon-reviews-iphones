While the phone itself works well overall, there were several issues that made it feel more like “good” rather than “excellent” condition: It arrived very dirty and required thorough cleaning. There were quite a lot of scratches on the body and screen. The battery health was only at 85%, which is noticeably worn for the price point. The packaging included only a USB-C to Lightning cable, no power adapter. There was tape over the cameras that left a sticky residue on the lenses and surrounding area. Despite these problems, the device functions properly, and I’ve had no performance issues so far. If you’re considering this refurbished model, I would still recommend it, but be prepared that the cosmetic condition may not fully match what’s advertised as “excellent.”","R1JOHMH9OHYP72",,,,,,,,,,,,"6","Overall a good phone, but not “excellent condition” as advertised","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1JOHMH9OHYP72","Reviewed in the United States on July 4, 2025","3610","192",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Space Black, Size: 256GB","B0BN96CCM6","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Space Black","Size","256GB"

Yes, I did get this phone for $405.67, which is a steal in my opinion.

But you can see where the screen was replaced on August 23rd, 2024 I would say give it a try Update April 11th, 2025 and there has been a battery drop and I think the drop is too fast. The last time I reported it was that the battery came with 86% battery health but now I’m gonna have to report as of April 11th it’s down to 83% battery health. I need to replace the battery already. (a star must be taken away) I should only see a 1% drop but to see a 3% in 90 days is a little alarming. In My experience with the iPhone (S), I saw the battery drop 3% within 90 days.

I really got amazed by the price, since in my country it was $200 more than here. Regarding the sending, the product arrived on time. I don’t live in the US, and when it arrived to Ecuador, I could finally check it. Color and storage capacity were as requested. Cameras work perfectly, same as the buttons, speakers and microphone. Dynamic Island works fantastic, and I’m even surprised for the AppleCare warranty. What I got disappointed about was the battery level, as I requested for a “Reconditioned-excellent” phone. Besides, the selling ad did not mention I was buying an ESIM version, so I had to change my chip. Ah, and let’s not forget the little dent you can see on the side. I confess I was very doubtful about buying here due to the comments: some positive and some really bad. My suggestion, buy at your own risk, but not ensuring to have a great phone or not.","R27CP2UEY5D5GS","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/614Wc1WIwnL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71PEk4Lg28L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71x22G45IRL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81r7SWZ6GTL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81t9Ulgi0+L._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,"28","Good phone, but not what I expected","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27CP2UEY5D5GS","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024","3610","192",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Deep Purple, Size: 256GB","B0BN96CCM6","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Deep Purple","Size","256GB"

I do wish they had done more to protect the phone, as it was just in a bubble-wrap sleeve, and the box was quite large, leaving the phone to just rattle around and bump into the particularly pointy prongs on the wall charger. There are a few scuffs on the screen that don't buff out with a microfiber cloth, but I don't know if that's because of the poor packaging or because it's a refurbished phone. I plan to put a screen protector on it anyway, so I'm not too concerned. This device IS refurbished. I wasn't expecting perfect, but the phone's condition did meet expectation. There are a few visible dings on the outside edge of the phone, and there are a few scuffs on the screen. The device powered on immediately, although the battery was nearly depleted, so a trip to a power receptacle was necessary. The phone only prompted me for my language, promptly dropping me on the home screen. This is my first foray with IOS devices, so being unsure about its lack of setup questions I went into Settings and did a factory reset. After going through a more thorough and proper setup, I checked both the battery health and warranty. The battery is at 97%, so it's definitely been used, but still within expectations. There's also still 4 months of warranty left from Apple! Overall, as long as you purchase this device with the understanding that it is refurbished, not new, then I believe this is a good choice for people who want the new iPhone experience without paying the full Apple Tax for a brand new device. I am a little concerned about the lack of initial setup questions (I work in an industry with a heavy focus on cyber security, so I'm a little paranoid about that stuff!) but it's easy enough to be absolutely sure that you're getting a freshly wiped device. I would recommend this product.","R1W4XXNFOM5G6V",,,,,,,,,,,,"49","Perfect, as long as you temper your expectations.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1W4XXNFOM5G6V","Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2023","3610","192",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Space Black, Size: 128GB","B0BN96CCM6","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Space Black","Size","128GB"

Después de todo el tiempo de uso, me di cuenta que la cámara tiene un pequeño error de desenfoque y se lo adjudiqué a ser un producto “reacondionado”, pero luego de hacer una investigación exhaustiva, puedo concluir que no es por el hecho de ser un producto reacondionado sino un defecto del iPhone 14 Pro, ya que más personas han reportado el mismo error en la cámara en productos nuevos de la tienda de Apple. Entonces, puedo concluir que el teléfono vino en excelentes condiciones, es totalmente funcional, el producto es lo que promete la publicación, pero pero recomiendo investigar el producto antes de comprarlo ya que puede que el producto venga con fallas de fábrica, es decir, no por ser reacondionado. Y pues, también recomiendo cotizar más el precio, ya que puede que los productos “nuevos” estén a su alcance en cuanto a precio, ya que si ahorras un poco más puedes conseguir un producto nuevo, pero si tu presupuesto no te da, esta es una buena opción de compra.","R14H7RENQE29GI","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ljU9KyiXL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,"38","Reseña en español - gente latinoamericana","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14H7RENQE29GI","Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2023","3610","192",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Deep Purple, Size: 128GB","B0BN96CCM6","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Deep Purple","Size","128GB"

Pretty amazing they sent me an Excellent Condition one with 100% Battety Health. Only issues I have with it is the screen and selfie camera. The screens auto brightness feature doesn’t work, as well as when they fixed the screen for refurbishment they obviously didn’t do it properly because it has no True Tone feature. Also I’m guessing the messed up when putting the screen back together in some way as the front facing camera has a sort of fogginess around it, although it doesn’t affect the cameras performance. Those features not being active is a bit of a let down and the OCD of the fogginess in the selfie camera is just irritating. Altogether though for buying it at its cheapest price I feel like I came out on top. Overall love the phone. Battery life is great, and of course IOS in general is just great. Recommend buying one if the price is right.","R1J2QYC3QRAP6V",,,,,,,,,,,,"3","Great Phone For A Semi Decent Price","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1J2QYC3QRAP6V","Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2024","3610","192",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Space Black, Size: 128GB","B0BN96CCM6","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Space Black","Size","128GB"

I purchased this phone THREE times to try and get one with a Maximum Battery Capacity that was acceptable. I saw people in reviews complaining about 92% - I wish! The first one I got had a max of 85%. My iPhone 12 Pro that is nearly 3 years old is at 85%... it seems if you are selling a refurbished phone that is a little over a year old and marked as ""excellent condition"" then it should have a higher capacity than a 3 year old phone. I ordered the phone again hoping the battery was a fluke, but phone 2 was only slightly better at 88%. I went for 'third try's a charm' and ordered again. This last one was at 92%. I decided that was the best I was going to get. The phone has otherwise been functioning great the last month. Very minimal scratches. Apple will do a battery replacement without any Apple Care coverage for a flat $99. So taking this $850 phone and maybe one day paying $99 for another batter is still a better deal than an additional $600 to get the 1TB iPhone 15 Pro model. So overall this is still a good deal and I had a very good experience with returning to 2 phones I chose not to keep. But I wish the seller would list what criteria need to be met to be marked as ""Excellent"" vs ""Good"".","R2Z9Y7XML5SMZT","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613MXk9r+-L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61DgRU1ljWL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61cqTXTQaAL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,,,"25","Battery Life So-So on 1TB Option","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2Z9Y7XML5SMZT","Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2023","3610","192",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Deep Purple, Size: 1TB","B0BN96CCM6","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Deep Purple","Size","1TB"

Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) I recently purchased a refurbished iPhone 14 Pro, and I am beyond pleased with my purchase. The phone arrived in exceptionally good condition, and I must say, it looks and feels like a brand new device. The battery health is at 93%, which is slightly below what I expected, aiming for 95% and above. However, considering the phone's performance, it's evident that it has hardly been used. The camera functions flawlessly, capturing crisp and clear images. One remarkable aspect is the difficulty in finding any scratch marks. It took me a week to notice them, showcasing how minor they are. This emphasizes the meticulous refurbishment process, ensuring that the phone maintains a near-new appearance. While I had a slight expectation for a higher battery health percentage, the overall quality, functionality, and the minimal signs of wear make this purchase entirely worth the investment. I'm thoroughly impressed with the condition of the phone and would highly recommend this refurbished iPhone 14 Pro to others. Kudos to the seller for delivering a product that exceeded my expectations!","R1V342JE3LIEUY",,,,,,,,,,,,,"iPhone 14 pro","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1V342JE3LIEUY","Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2023","3610","192",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Deep Purple, Size: 128GB","B0BN96CCM6","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Deep Purple","Size","128GB"

The main thing I can say about it though is that it is very overpriced; and that is no surprise if you are an Apple fan. Features compared to same phones of the same period are more expensive, so you may want to give it a go first. If you are switching from Android, you will see this more easily; but for Apple users it has value and the new features added are useful and worthwhile. Screen is fine overall, and this is the same exact phone you get year after year, a bit faster, with less and less connections (even the SIM card slot is gone... ), so nothing new here. Performances are great; it can handle most of what you throw at it basically.

However, there were a few aspects that determined how many stars this review would recieved. The phone itself was in good condition, there were a few smudges on the side, but that was wiped off easily. The little film that's on top of the phone was dirty, I didn't really mind about that though. The thing that really disappointed me was the battery life. The phone is 88% battery life. I would expect more from a one year old phone, but that's average after a year, I'd expect a higher battery life and I know I wouldn't get anything better if I replaced it. Another thing I didn't like was the cheap chinese brick and cable, in 5 minutes it wouldn't even go up by 1%! If you buy this product, make sure to buy a good cable and brick as well.

It was just flopping around inside of the box. That really set the mood for the rest of my experience. Secondly, there was no paperwork, just an iPhone and a charger, absolutely zero documentation of any kind. Sure it's easy to set up an iPhone and you don't really need any documentation to do so, but I'd at least like to know who sent me my product. Third, once the iPhone was set up it seemed to be in great condition. However the more I used it the more I realized it was junk. The display was absolutely not 120hz, it barely looked 60hz, but that may have been because the operating system of the iPhone was running very poorly, probably because it has been repaired with cheap, non-genuine parts. The front facing camera had very poor picture quality, so much so that the facial recognition refused to work for me. The touch screen was absolutely awful. My shattered iPhone 11 is easier to use. When scrolling, it would jump along without being able to smoothly follow my finger. Typing was a hassle because it would struggle to register my taps, and when it did it often input double characters and whatever letter was near what I was tapping. Good luck trying to type a password with that phone. Oh, and the battery health was a nice 70% when I checked it. Lastly, I don't know who the actual merchant is for this product. Depending on which options you choose, you'll end up buying from a different merchant. Before purchasing my product it said it was sold by Amazon.com, now with the exact same options it says it's DirectCertified. My order also says it was sold by DirectCertified, but at the time of purchase it said Amazon.com. Do NOT waste your money or your time with this merchant. I didn't walk, I RAN to my carrier and traded in this pile of garbage. I could have dealt with one or two of the problems since it was refurbished, but for the price and for this being a ""Refurbished - Excellent"" product, I found it to be absolutely unacceptable.","R38LL4QXMMH7V",,,,,,,,,,,,"88","For a ""Refurbished - Excellent"" product, I was severely disappointed!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38LL4QXMMH7V","Reviewed in the United States on September 19, 2024","3610","390",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Space Black, Size: 128GB","B0BN96CCM6","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Space Black","Size","128GB"

When I received it and got it out of the box I noticed it had a lot of scuffing along the edges and wear on the side buttons. I was a little bummed it looked so used already, but not a huge deal because I would put a case on it anyways, right? So I continue phone set up and everything went great. I did notice the phone was already getting a little hot while I was using it, so that had me a little worried. I realized I hadn’t taken a picture yet to see how much better the quality was than the 12 pro I had previously been using. This is where I ran into major issues with the phone. The camera will not focus at all. I can toggle the lens focal length in and out and somewhat get it to focus for a short second, but other than that… nothing. So I insist the lenses and the bottom left lens looks odd. If you look close it looks damaged or like it has glue rubbed on it, or replaced with some kind of cheap plastic lens. I can’t figured out what exactly was done to this lens, but it does not work! I compared to a family members iPhone 14 Pro and that lens doesn’t look like hers does that works perfectly. I’m pretty upset they let a refurbished phone in this condition be resold to someone, especially when I selected the “excellent condition” option when purchasing. I wouldn’t label this as a working phone. I am returning it.","R1V2KZ2OOLHYWN","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51h7dw-Lg+L._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,"8","Way less than excellent condition","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1V2KZ2OOLHYWN","Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2025","3610","390",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Space Black, Size: 256GB","B0BN96CCM6","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Space Black","Size","256GB"

Upon arrival, it has scratches on the front and rear and along the bottom edge on the right side is missing the silver and feels rough like the phone has been previously dropped. There was also a glue like substance around all of the camera lenses on the back. The phone came in a box that wasn’t sealed properly. The charging cord that came in the box does not fit this phone, like WTH. Good thing I had a iPhone charger from my previous phone or I’d be screwed. The phone should not be considered “excellent” just on the physical appearance alone. Now, the battery health is at 84%, which is low in my opinion. When I charged the phone for the first time, it would not charge past 80%. I tried again a few hours later and it charges so slow, on my fast charger. My last gripe is that when I was setting up my phone with my iCloud every so often a pop up would say that “This device is associated with another iCloud” and that it can only be linked to a different account every 90 days, there is a countdown that I have to wait 68 days. This is crazy. Some of the options are not there because the phone is on another account. I don’t think I should be having these problems. I should be happy getting a phone, but it’s been a headache. My last excellent condition refurbished iPhone was purchased on eBay and everything about that experience and the quality of that phone (it was like new with no scratches and physically perfect) and battery health was at 90% excellent. I should have purchased on there instead of this crap. The only reason I purchased the phone on here was that the shipping was faster.","RNIYMVIKTPWBU","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/610MPH8PnaL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61L3jWjLpLL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,,,,"23","Not Happy- Excellent Condition, Where?!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RNIYMVIKTPWBU","Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2025","3610","390",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Silver, Size: 256GB","B0BN96CCM6","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Silver","Size","256GB"

While in the midst of transferring my current iPhone info to this iPhone and updating it to the latest IOS version the phone started displaying a Temperature too hot message even though the phone was cool to the touch. I later read this could be due to a faulty battery. It would not power off and I had to wait 3 days for the battery to drain and the phone to shut down. In any event, because my phone number had already been ported to this faulty phone, I had no phone service. Had to go and purchase a new SIM card. Asked for an exchange with the seller and they responded to messages only once per day. They provided me with an address to return the phone but when I asked for a prepaid label, they said they would provide one and never sent it. That was 7 days ago. They never apologized for any inconvenience to me, and having no phone, having to go into the phone store, and not getting responses was a huge inconvenience. Don’t buy from this seller! I tried Amazon refurbished and I don’t think I will try it again after this experience. I did get a quick refund from Amazon after returning it on the upside. Ended up getting the same model of phone from a reputable seller on eBay and it works wonderful and has 1 year warranty instead of 90 days like Amazon.

You hear horror stories about bad ESN’s and phones that money is owed on them. So, I decided to look on Amazon. Found this phone and seller and ordered the iPhone. When it arrived I took it to the Apple Store to have a screen protector installed. They tried two different ones and both would not adhere completely to the glass. They determined the glass was flawed with a ripple at the bottom not allowing the bubbles to escape. I contacted the seller and they said I could send it back a just order another one. So, I did. The second one had the exact same problem. I sent that one back and ended up buying a new iPhone 15 Pro from the Apple Store. Today, I received a message from the seller that they received my return but will not refund my purchase. They are claiming that the unit that I returned was not purchased from them!?! I told them they had mistaken and it was indeed purchased from them and definitely nobody else! I even sent them screen shots of the ESN screens before I sent it back. Now I’m on the phone with Amazon customer support reporting this company. This is a very unfortunate situation. I buy a lot on amazon and have NEVER had a problem like this! I think they may be refurbing these phones with defective screens.","RH1YV59SGVLM2",,,,,,,,,,,,"36","TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE! 2 DEFECTIVE iPHONES - REFUSED TO REFUND!

It says ""Unknown Part"" in the battery section, meaning they swapped out the Apple battery for a different non-genuine battery. There's a slight burn in which is typically caused by a misused battery. And it's stuck in a boot loop, it keeps shutting itself off COMPLETELY and then turning back on every 10 minutes or so. It came with a bunch of grime on the camera lenses, and as I'm writing this, it just booted up again. It also took a full week to get here, which is weird considering I used Prime, and all the other options didn't take as long. Sincerely feel like I got ripped off. It's a genuine iPhone 14 Pro, but they replaced the battery (not officially), stuck in a boot loop, has burn-in from the screen, and had weird grime when i got it. I will probably be returning this.","RIANE8WUI74TY",,,,,,,,,,,,"2","Scammy!

Even called Apple to see if they could help. The only thing Apple found was that the phone was a demo phone. So I returned the phone. I had to return it back to the third party seller.

I had to contact Amazon for help and returned the phone back to the company. Surprisingly enough they refunded me the second time I returned the phone.

This one you see in the video (the second one) was almost the same, no scratches, clean but 88% of battery which is not that bad but could be better.

The screen had a small scratch and the ear piece was all fuzzy making it very hard to hear anyone unless they were on speaker. I returned the phone and ordered a new one right away hoping the next phone would be better. Then the real trouble came. It’s now been 8 months and no refund even though the status says the refund was accepted. I have tried contacting the seller and reached out to Amazon and still haven’t received my $800+. The second phone almost immediately was dropping calls, echoing but I don’t want to return in fear I won’t be refunded for that one either.

Once i turned on the phone, it told me that the screen was not recognized. My guess is that this refurbished phone had probably a broken screen, and they decided to replace with a non original apple part. The problem is that the new screen was very low quality. You could feel it when you scroll, its very slow. Also, to go out from ""always on"" mode, double tapping was not working... I decided to return it. they didn""t even give me a returning label. I had to pay for shipping. End of the day, lost time and money, horrible experience.

There is an Apple logo visible with low brightness and a dark screen. The logo is much larger than the logo that appears when you turn your phone on so my thought is that there is a sticker somewhere inside the phone from the knockoff parts. This needs to be caught by Amazon QC if they are going to guarantee the quality of refurbished phones.

While the exterior of the phone looks great and it functions well overall, I was disappointed to discover that the battery health is at 84%. For a device listed as “excellent,” I expected a much higher battery capacity—closer to 90% or more. Battery health directly affects performance and daily usability, and this level of wear makes it feel more like a “good” or “acceptable” condition device rather than excellent. I understand that it’s a used product, but I would have appreciated a clear mention of the battery percentage in the product description before purchase.( I will return the phone ) A battery replacement is an added expense, ( 99 dollars ) and at this price point, transparency matters. Still evaluating the phone’s overall performance, but so far, this one issue has been a letdown.","R286STCYWL7MZU","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61qM7kcSMAL._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,"Battery life","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R286STCYWL7MZU","Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2025","3610","137",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Space Black, Size: 1TB","B0BN96CCM6","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Space Black","Size","1TB"

Amazon notes that excellent condition means “no visible damage from 8 inches away.” This must have been inspected by somebody who doesn’t care as even a blind person would know this is not scratch free. There are pitted scratches all around the front and back edges and the two right corners are really bad someone obviously dropped it and it rolled on concrete or other rough surface. Two corners are scratched obviously and visible from 5’ away and I don’t even have 20/20 vision. The phone seems to function well now but during file transfer it got really hot at the edges where you hold the phone. I will be returning for one that actually meets the description not only for esthetics but if this was dropped without a case from a height to make these pitted scratches I would question whether the internal elements have been affected or lessened. Battery health was at 88% which is just lower than the standard of 90% or better, for the premium which is a step up from “excellent” so really my only complaint is the physical condition. I would have accepted this as a “fair” or even “good” condition buy but am disappointed that this got out the door as “excellent”.

I went with them because I'd previously bought an iPhone 11 for my brother that didn't have any problems. The phone was claimed to be in excellent condition (no scratches on the screen or visible damage to the body from 12 inches away, according to the Amazon Renewed policy) but arrived with some small scratches on the top of the screen and a dot in the middle that didn't buff out with a microfiber cloth, almost like it'd been punched with a pencil or something. There are some dings on the corners and overall just not in the condition it was claimed to be. Battery was at 96% health and the screen seems to work fine, maybe a little less sensitive than I expected. The phone was not packed well, just a small bit of packing material that allowed the phone to rattle around in the box. Inside the Amazon box the phone came in a very thin paper box that didn't provide much protection. It came with an aftermarket USB-A to Lightning charger with no wall adapter. I'd say this was probably closer to Acceptable condition (per the Renewed policy) than Excellent condition. I'm going to try and get a refund or replacement because it's not worth what I paid for it.","R2WBB0TM1XKBJ7","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71MkLw4tn+L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71YA5je7RaL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ibji98suL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81T5hHrwD5L._SY88.jpg",,,,,,,,,"Bought in ""excellent condition"" but came with scratches","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WBB0TM1XKBJ7","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2023","3610","137",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Space Black, Size: 128GB","B0BN96CCM6","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Space Black","Size","128GB"

This phone was sold as unlocked only to arrive with passcode which meant I could not use it beyond just switching it on. The anxiety that followed is unparalleled! I engaged seller who although they were responsive didn't offer me a solution beyond try iTunes or send it back for a refund. I then engaged Apple Support who were much more supportive, tried to walk me through the process to restore it although we didn't succeed . They then suggested I walk in to my nearest Apple Store which is eventually what worked, thankfully the phone had no iCloud connected to it despite still having the passcode. The phone itself is great so far, I don't see any scratches or obvious faults. Battery health is actually still at 100% which is awesome. I've only managed to set the phone up in the last hour or so so I'm yet to explore much more. I would have rated highly but I'm just annoyed at this setback.

I've tried everything I could to unban it but unfortunately there's nothing more I can do except to return it and get a different device. It's my first time purchasing a refurbished iphone from Amazon so I wasn't sure what to expect since I was already hesitant to buy it at first, but I guess it makes more sense that there would be something about it that couldn't make it perfect because as we all know, when something seems to good to be true, it normally is.

It was factory reset and easy to get started with and setting up. The only problems I have found is the button on the left for turning to do not disturb...slips. It is not a full set and often times it glitches between ring and no ring or does not fully engage to one or the other. Another minor issue I have found is the volume does not turn up as high as it should. This does cause some issues with hearing calls but for the most part I have been able to make it work good enough. All this being said, I think it was safe buying used but was still qutie expensive considering it does having some function issues.

The iOS which was loaded was 16.1.1 which was perfect as I intended to jailbreak the device(the current jailbreak only goes up to 16.5). There were several physical defects that I could spot immediately, one was a small area of faded paint next to the apple logo, and there were odd puncture looking scratches on every button of the device as if someone used a screwdriver to press them repeatedly. My other qualm was the battery health which seemed to be a bit low at 88%. The device functions as expected like any other iPhone, but for the price, I expected a better condition and battery health.

The first three looked and performed like a new phone, so I assumed I would get the same quality when I purchased again. Not the case. The phone has scratches all around the metal frame and the screen has several scratches. The battery health is at 92%, my original iPhone 14 that I have had for over a year is at 99%, so not sure what is up with this one. I would think that if the battery is below 95% they would just go ahead and replace it while they are reconditioning these, it would probably save a lot of returns.
