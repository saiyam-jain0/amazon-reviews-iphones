Yes, this 12 PM is refurbished as well, but it was almost $200 less and 2yrs newer. I chose a seller who had very high customer satisfaction ratings and paid a little more than the cheapest price shown. For that extra $$, I got a refurbished “excellent” phone that looks brand new and shows 96% battery capacity. Unless something goes wrong and it stops working, I’m happy with my purchase. Edit: the sound isn’t very loud from the speakers, not as loud as my XS Max that this phone replaced. I have to press my ear tight to the ear speaker to hear a call. Speakerphone isn’t great either.

First, the phone arrived in great packaging, well protected, and no outer blemishes or problems. When beginning the setup process, it continued to get stuck on choosing the country. After several restarts, it would just get stuck on country. So I did some research. I also contacted the company at this time. Ultimately I learned online that I needed to connect it to my laptop, upgrade the software, then do the setup. That time it completed setup (after several attempts). However, now the phone was in SOS mode. I didn't think much of it because I did not have the sim in at that time. This complete process took about 2 hours. After I put in the sim and started the phone, the network still said SOS. More research. Still no call from the company. About 6 hours later, 4 attempts at factory reset to start over, and chatting with my cell carrier, I gave up with the phone still in SOS mode. It was still updating all my apps though, so I let this happen throughout the night. The next morning I called my carrier again and they worked me through a few more things. Ultimately they had to do a reset on the sim because something in the phone was triggered as being hacked so it shut off the sim as well. I'm not sure how this really happens, but this is what was told to me in layman's terms. Thankfully after another hour in the morning, my carrier was able to get the SOS mode off and reset. It is now working well and continuing life as usual, with an updated phone. So, buyer beware. If you're buying a phone online to save money, make sure it has some kind of return policy. This one did, and we were originally told by our carrier that we may have to return the phone. I'm glad we pushed through the problem, because I hate doing that. However, just be prepared for some kind of issues to pop up. We would have had to pay the Apple Store or somebody else to fix it IF it didn't have a return possible. Ultimately this phone ended up being ok. The looks are fantastic; no scratches or blemishes. We are not sure on battery life yet, and I will update this review IF I see the battery life is diminished. Otherwise, besides the problems we had in the beginning, the phone has been overall good and now functioning well.","R39R2U5814W8J2",,,,,,,,"24","Ended up ok but started out as a nightmare","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R39R2U5814W8J2","Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2022","7635","163",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Pacific Blue, Size: 512GB","B08PL89SJS","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Pacific Blue","Size","512GB"

Battery health: Not very good for a phone in supposed ""excellent"" condition. The battery capacity is at a measly 77%. I'm actually very disappointed by that, as I would have hoped for at least 85%. In fact, with nearly a quarter of the battery capacity gone, I can't give the product any more than 3 stars. I charged the phone to 50% before work at 5:30. Occasional scroll and about 20 minutes of Youtube videos dropped it down to 30% in just a few hours.

But after reading the other reviews I thought I’d have a good chance of getting a good phone. After I got my black iPhone 12 Pro Max with 128gb, I saw that some of the sides had scratches on them. I didn’t mind them too much because with a cover it was literally impossible to see them. The battery health was at 81% which was a bummer but it is what it is. The screen was okay at first. It worked well. Then one night it just it wouldn’t work so I had to turn off the phone and turn it back on. A day after I got the phone, I tried putting a screen protector on it. I had 4 of them. I thoroughly cleaned the screen before putting them on. Yet for each one, there were always some spot or damage shown on the screen which I think the screen protector revealed. At first I thought I didn’t clean the screen properly or put them on properly. But after the fourth one I realized the hidden damages on the screen. And this phone was listed at being in “excellent” condition smh. I’m most likely gonna return it because it isn’t worth $475 imo. Just be careful y’all.","R2PJ0BLAHXICZX",,,,,,,,"9","It’s a gamble","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2PJ0BLAHXICZX","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2024","7635","163",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Graphite, Size: 128GB","B08PL89SJS","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Graphite","Size","128GB"

Set up normally, screen works great, camera is flawless, and speakers/microphone has no issues. Now, I purchased one that was supposed to be in like new/ excellent condition but I received a phone with a chip in the screen. Not sure if this flaw just snuck by their quality control or if this would pass their standards.. but it’s subpar and I would hope for the price this isn’t the standard for the seller.

It also came with a glass screen protector from the previous owners which had little cracks that scared me at first thinking it was the phone screen. Lastly, it wasn’t a big deal but the phone was set to a different language than the English setting i selected at first, so I had to reset the phone myself once more after receiving it. Other than that the software works and has served me fine for the past month while I’ve tried it out.

When I got the phone, I had to change it all into English, which was fine, but a red flag. When I bought the phone, it said the condition was excellent. The phone would not hold a charge throughout the day and was constantly extremely hot whether I used it for even a small amount of time or had to charge it from a low (charge) percentage. One day after about 3 months, it just completely stopped working and gave me a black screen. It would not charge. I tried to get it to work through Apple customer service and my Apple laptop. I also spent approximately 6 hours at my cell phone carrier trying to get it to charge up. Finally, I gave up and just bought a new iPhone 16 after the manager informed me we had exhausted every option at this point. I contacted Amazon for a refund and even requested an additional review after I was denied. Amazon told me that I could only return the phone up to 14 days after purchase, which is ridiculous because I would assume a phone would work after 3 months! So now I am out of $450 and I bought all 12pro max accessories that I’m out of money as well. I ended up having to buy the new iPhone 16 anyway which I should have just bought from my phone carrier in the first place. I now have a $450 phone that is unusable whatsoever. I have never written a negative review, but this is very unfair to me.","RFIR4CPJY1YY3",,,,,,,,"34","Buyer of IPhone seller!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RFIR4CPJY1YY3","Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025","7635","577",,,"Service Provider: T-Mobile, Color: Gold, Size: 128GB","B08PL89SJS","Service Provider","T-Mobile","Color","Gold","Size","128GB"

I have purchase this directly from Apple. Issues: - the charger set is not the stardard Apple set. I would suggest not using it at all. The actual charging wire is extremely short and the box is extremely flimsy and I can guarantee you it will get hot. I’m using my standard Apple charger that comes with phones and products nowadays to charge this phone because I absolutely do not trust the charger set that it comes with. - the battery life is CRAP! My battery capacity is at 85%. I am upgrading from an iPhone XS Max which is currently sitting at 80% so it is not worth the upgrade. I charged the phone for an hour and it just keeps dying. Yes I am setting it up but it dies like my xs max. Pass - delivery: I waited around all day. And instead of delivering this pretty early, this phone sat in the truck all day in the cold. So I don’t know if it will have any effect on performance, but I’m not happy about it. - immediately after initially posting this review, I turned the phone over and looked at the camera, and I was horrified. There was so much gunk around the lenses of the camera. I was absolutely disgusted. So not only do you know for a fact that this is a pre-used phone, but furthermore Amazon did not clean the phone at all. I now purchased the same device from Apple and the battery capacity is at 100%. I paid $208 more but I think the quality the experience the delivery the phone itself is so much better and made it worth it. Pros: The phone works if you are in a pinch and you don’t want to buy directly from Apple I guess this will do. But honestly as someone who has a lot of experience with buying refurbished goods, especially when it comes to Apple, this is the worst product I have. And the price keeps fluctuating. I paid $495 and the seller was amazon.com and the shipping was Amazon as well so I bought direct. I am using the phone now to type out this review and the microphone works but overall I really would not suggest buying this product from Amazon. It will not come with the product box nor will it come with the standard Apple charger. Also, please bear in mind that they are not going to issue a refund for 30 days. This was a complete waste of time money and energy waiting for this phone when I could’ve just bought it from Apple. Learning lesson. Hope this helps someone.","RR4F7RLF0GQGK",,,,,,,,"44","Pass- buy refurb from Apple if possible","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RR4F7RLF0GQGK","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2023","7635","577",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Graphite, Size: 128GB","B08PL89SJS","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Graphite","Size","128GB"

In 2022, I decided to switch to Apple because I respected some of their corporate governance and wanted to reward them, so I started out with this device. WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK. Touch stinks. Autocorrect stinks. Predictive text stinks. Voice stinks. Hardware problems, including battery charging problems. Didn't yet have haptic feedback when I bought it in 2022! Can't select and paste partial text from messages... Even the Apple case I bought cracked the first time I tried to take the phone out again. The first time I went to set an alarm, I couldn't use the clock.. I had to go to Sleep app, sign in, then it redirected me to another Health app, and another sign-in, just to set up the first alarm. I should have stopped there. The learning curve from Android to Apple was very easy, but the device and its function are WEAK. Keep working on your cameras and emojis, Apple. That's what Steve Jobs would want - not quality and innovation.... I have so many daily frustrations with this thing, I absolutely hate it and I will *** N E V E R *** buy another Apple product for my own use. The only way I could see this being of any value is if you have every aspect of your life integrated with Apple devices and applications... but that seems like a longshot, given this chunk of garbage. I am switching back to Android as soon as this POS breaks down completely, which I anticipate will be very soon.","RIW5D75QEJN95",,,,,,,,"8","This thing is garbage.

On this pro max it was deep scratches and on the 12 pro a massive crack running the length of the screen. I ordered a renewed excellent condition iPhone 12 Pro Max. When getting ready to apply a screen protector I noticed the top right corner of the screen was cracked. On closer inspection I found it was a screen protector, but when I removed it I found there was a thick adhesive type layer that fills in the gaps on numerous scratches of the actual screen so you can’t see them. At first I thought no big deal - great reviews so must be a one time weird thing and didn’t like the size of the pro max anyways, so I bought an excellent condition iPhone 12 Pro after this phone. Same thing this time, but worse. Rather than deep screen scratches, there’s a massive crack running the length of the screen underneath the screen protector. This wouldn’t be visible without removing the screen protector that comes on it but regardless, two iPhone 12’s in a row through renewed (not renewed premium) have hided the fact that these are not excellent condition in the slightest. And rather than replacing the screen, the seller has covered up the damage in the cheapest way possible. Lots of good reviews for these, so I imagine not all are as bad as mine. But, considering this happened back to back, it isn’t a coincidence and I’m sure others have been scammed by this as well. So please make sure to inspect the phone very closely upon delivery so you can return it if this is the case. Very deceptive practice.","R2SO6XWI212S59","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615XACG6NML._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/617IgHuN66L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61WBQJpBGKL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61l+m+lEyoL._SY88.jpg",,,,"31","PLEASE READ BEFORE BUYING - COVERED UP SCREEN DAMAGE","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2SO6XWI212S59","Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2023","7635","577",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Graphite, Size: 256GB","B08PL89SJS","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Graphite","Size","256GB"

Semi excited semi worried. When i open the box and the bubble wrap and everything i received i cracked phone. I breathed in and out and said okay its fineee just turn it on use while you can and request an exchange. I have clients and personal matters to deal with so i really needed a phone. THE PHONE DIDNT EVEN TURN ON!!!!! Ridiculous!!! WHATEVER. At that moment i decided ill never ever buy a phone off of amazon. I love amazon and many other things ive bought from them turned out fine. Even a little table i bought came scratched but i let it be. So i return the phone and submit why. They wanna say they opened the phone and it wasnt theres!!!! Ive should have grabbed my ipad or computer and recorded what came in the box. Can’t believe they pulled this off!!! Becareful!!! U might get a cracked phone or a good phone.

I went to Apple and exhausted all troubleshooting options, but nothing worked. I went as far as changing my network provider and I was still having the same issue with the phone. After changing my network I place my sim in a different phone and it worked so I knew it was not the network it was the phone. I have had a such horrible experience with this phone thus far. The amount of money that was spent troubleshooting the issue should have been compensated for. Even after returning the phone, I was charged a restocking fee...

The first iPhone was advertised as unlocked to any carrier, but when I tried to connect it through my carrier I found that it was LOCKED. This was a huge inconvenience as I needed the device as soon as it arrived. The second iPhone I ordered stopped working within a week of use! Screen went black and won't come back on. Despite following all recommended usage guidelines and taking good care of the device, it suddenly stopped functioning and screen went black, leaving me AGAIN without a reliable means of communication. Overall, I'm deeply disappointed with these purchases. The phones did not meet ANY standards of functionality and usability. I had hoped for better quality considering they were labeled as renewed and sold through Amazon. I've reached out to Amazon customer service for assistance, all they do is direct you to a return process. I now have $750 in limbo with their return process and NO PHONE.

After battling with Amazon customer service for nearly a month, contacting the seller, and troubleshooting. I was pretty much told it was nobody’s problem and to screw off. After all that, they also never returned emails, phone calls, Or other communications attempts. Shirley of Amazon customer service leader ship was the only one that returned any communications. However, even then, she blatantly lied about filing a claim with their A-Z team (Which I have email proof of.) No one is held accountable, there is no one you can go to in person, It is nobody’s problem. At the end of the day, we simply have to trust in our Amazon overlords. 😤","R2H5JX0N1RGK5Z",,,,,,,,"3","Do not ever buy phones from this seller, or Amazon.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2H5JX0N1RGK5Z","Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2024","7635","577",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Graphite, Size: 512GB","B08PL89SJS","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Graphite","Size","512GB"

For one if you buy refurbished you have no clue what you’re getting I did a serial look up on this particular phone and it’s 2 years 8 months old it must’ve had a hard life either in construction or something because it has taken me about 10 minutes just to type up this review due to how unresponsive the touch screen is absolutely terrible experience.

The Phone looks brand new, but the speaker is not working correctly. I need to return, but I have no other phone now.

When first bought it was like brand new, perfect shine and no scratches. Battery life did gradually get shorter and run out of charge over time quicker as the months passed. I had the phone for almost two years. Nice, slick feel in your hand without a case. Phone was super easy to unlock and get situated with my phone company. Everything transferred over quick and without hassle or having to go to a phone store. However after too many falls to the ground over time, the day I gave birth to my son it decided to go green and pink screen. The camera quality also got bad over time from a crack in the lense. Luckily I didn’t lose any pictures or data but it was really inconvenient to have the phone die the day I give birth to my son and then had to spend the next two days phoneless.

This battery health is 89% and my iPhone I own before buying this is at 76%. That’s one reason why I bought this iPhone. Today I also learned from experience that the reason why it has three camera lenses is because each lens is different so they are zoomed in differently. You get 1x, and 2.5x on Portrait mode. On normal photo mode, you get 0.5, 1x and 2.5x. If you are a busy mom or a professional photographer, you probably will want some kind of iPhone that has three lens. Just imagine all the different ways you could take pictures and selfies and everything from the same distance, but using a different lens to change the whole entire game! Plus, the battery life! I can’t really say much about the battery life within the first 24 hours unless something bad was happening like battery leakage or something like that but right now everything is great so I don’t think we have anything to worry about there. I loved for the fact I was able to get the accessories for this model. It’s important to always make sure that whatever phone you get for yourself allows you to get the accessories that you need including the phone case so that’s always a plus. Switching iPhones can be a little bit confusing, but I’m a young person and I’m pretty tech savvy so I was able to learn things pretty quickly so if somebody is able to adapt to technology that is similar to what this is then they probably won’t have a problem, but for somebody who doesn’t know anything about Apple, they might want to start with an iPhone that has the physical home button. This model does not have a physical home button so they might want to get a slightly different phone if they are having that problem. It’s pretty easy to set it up if you’re familiar with iCloud. There should be enough space if you’re using iCloud for all of your photos and pictures and even if you’re playing video games, you probably will have enough space on here unless you’re downloading every single song on Spotify (I don’t recommend downloading every song on Spotify because it will eat up your whole entire phone if you have 128 GB). My recommendation is if you do buy this iPhone is to get the glass to protect the screen. Preferably I recommend the one that gives you privacy, but if you don’t want that one, you can just get the clear one because at least it will protect your screen, even if you drop it in a parking lot. I have seen many people of various generations break iPhones and other cell phones and when I use the glass protection, it has protected me over the years and it’s pretty cheap like all you gotta do is change out your glass about one to two times a year compared to the price of fixing a phone screen with a professional or the other option is deal with stupid tape all over your screen so I really recommend getting the glass. It’s annoying at first dealing with the air bubbles, but it is totally worth it financially, so please consider it! Only problems I’m having is an error about the outer cameras and a loose port.","R2UOKHG2YIK1U3",,,,,,,,"2","Better than those eBay deals!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2UOKHG2YIK1U3","Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2024","7635","263",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Graphite, Size: 128GB","B08PL89SJS","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Graphite","Size","128GB"

I was not happy about that however the cost of a new battery is $100 so even with that it's still cheaper than Apple refurbished.","RJPI85EQ0K0L6",,,,,,,,,"As expected.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJPI85EQ0K0L6","Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2024","7635","263",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Pacific Blue, Size: 512GB","B08PL89SJS","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Pacific Blue","Size","512GB"

When it came, I tested that the sound, camera, the screen quality, battery life and space were decent, and I was pleasantly surprised that everything worked as if the phone was brand new. The only problem, and it’s a big one, is that they did not send a charger with the phone, which was advertised on this listing. Thankfully, someone else in my house had a charger I could use, otherwise, the phone battery would have died on me before I could even look at anything. I reached out to support for that missing piece and they wanted me to start a whole return just to send me the charger. It was more of a hassle to return the phone after all the setup, than it was to just buy a new charger so I just ordered one online. If this is not an inconvenience or too big of a deal for you, then I’d still recommend this phone.

Physically, the phone is in the conditions stated. BUT came LOCKED by AT&T with an UNPAID DEBT. I sent a request to AT&T to try to unlock it, but they rejected my request due to the unpaid debt attached to phone (through the IMEI number), making it absolutely USELESS to me. It is unbelievable how the Amazon Renewed Store sells a phone that DOES NOT comply with the standards and conditions that they declare in the product's description. They CLEARLY establish that: ""Fully unlocked and compatible with any carrier of choice (e.g. AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, Verizon, US-Cellular, Cricket, Metro, etc.)."" But this is a total LIE since I can't even use the phone right now due to it being locked. I'm awaiting for the seller's response regarding this. UPDATE: (12/28/22) I wrote to the seller on Monday 26th, and they promptly responded with an explanation (a badge of phones were still locked) and a solution (wait 24-72 hrs for the on air unlocking). Safe to say that, just as they said, 24 hrs later the phone was fully unlocked. Changed the rating from 1 star to 4 stars (not going to give 5 due to this issue, but TBH they deserved it). Phone is in PRISTINE conditions, battery health at 90%, no scratches, blemishes, etc. on the phone. First Renewed phone I've bought and I'm happy with it.","R7F4KXWQBRUPH",,,,,,,,"69","MISLEADING Description - LOCKED phone with UNPAID DEBT with Phone Carrier (FIXED)","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7F4KXWQBRUPH","Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2022","7635","263",,,"Service Provider: Unlocked, Color: Graphite, Size: 256GB","B08PL89SJS","Service Provider","Unlocked","Color","Graphite","Size","256GB"

But I broke my phone right before Thanksgiving and had very limited options -- this one was the best value for what I was looking for. Delivery came exactly on time (5 days with the holiday). The phone was admittedly a little dirty - some fingerprints on the edges, the speaker was dusty - but that was an easy fix. Was it annoying to have to clean it? Yeah, they should come already cleaned (that's why it gets 4 stars) but -- hey, I needed this phone. There are like two barely visible scratches on the screen; you can't even see them from arm's distance (holding your phone at normal length). You can only see them if you're looking for them and they're smaller than a cat hair. I'm totally happy with that. Phone is in great condition, started up fine, everything works. I just popped my SIM card in from my old phone and didn't have a single minute of disrupted phone service; everything transferred over fine.

It’s a 5g and fully unlocked as indicated by the seller however the only reason I gave 4 stars because … the 5g keeps switching into LTE and my provider says the reason being is depending of the of the signal and where the tower is located.

I did not receive the iPhone 12 Pro Max in its original case, but that is honestly better, as it came with a screen protector already on, a charger, and a charging cable.

Screen is clean, no scratches. Some small scratches on reverse side on shiny apple logo. Phone was packages in a generic smartphone device box that had an Android logo on it? Odd. Setup went fine and everything is working! Cost was 2/3 of apple refurbished and would have went with apple if what I wanted had been available from apple. So this forces me to try something new, save a little money and hopefully works out well. Haven’t tried to sign this phone to Apple Care but I am not expecting to be available. Gotta say the packaging is really cheezy. I know apple is over the top but this was just totally lacking. First inclination was return it immediately based iPhone in an android boz alone.

I really regret buying it. As one of my friends bought the same thing and he said that it’s ok, it has a few a few scratches but everything works perfectly. I was convinced to get one. And my budget was a little tight to buy the original one from Apple Store. And also the reason I bought the refurbished one is that iPhone 12 has sim tray while IPhone 14 hasn’t. The moment I got my refurbished iPhone 12 Pro Max. I easily noticed a scratch on the screen but it’s not a biggie since I kinda expected it. At first I didn’t realize the flaws but eventually the phone start acting up like the screen is deeming itself on its own. And the camera wasn’t working properly. I wanted to return it for an exchange but I work on a ship and returning it is really not an option as we don’t have time to get off in canaveral. Plus we can’t bring out an item with the box without declaring it to the custom. And that requires too much time and effort. Plus I need to look for a postal office to send it to Amazon. In short, I’ve learned not to buy refurbished next time.

After getting it fully set up (waiting for apps to load, re-enrolling various authenticators, re-establishing secure access for special apps, getting emails set up, etc., which took about half a day), I checked and found the battery capacity was only 77%. They offered that I could use Amazon replacement, but that option was not available in my orders. They said my options were to either send the phone back and await a replacement (which would mean setting up my old phone again and then setting up the replacement--another wasted day) or ordering a replacement, paying up front, then sending back the phone that is not as described (a wasted half day). I have no faith that doing that would result in me getting what I paid for. They would not provide a partial refund to make up for their failure. The phone is otherwise working fine.

While fully charged the screen does a dimming flickering effect I hate as my vision is impaired I need the phone display to stay lit Also swipe text is also sketchy. I love the size, camera decent quality face security to 20 attempts for it to properly capture my face for unlocking phone and logging in to other apps. Condition was nice few scratches along the bottom edge as this was a pre owned device so it was expected to have some defects scratches but barely noticeable.

The listing is legit and there are good reviews. I used it for about 2 weeks and it worked fine other than the fact that they put cheap parts in it to repair it, for example the screen pixels are very visible and the black letters will have a rainbow outline, the battery doesn’t hold a charge as long as it should and overheats when charging. I chose to look past it and think nothing of it, well that was until it just didn’t turn on anymore. I didn’t expose it to any water or anything, it just won’t turn on. I feel as though I spent over $600 on a piece of junk. I had a problem with the delivery of my package in the beginning, I was in the shower when they tried to deliver it so they brought it to the post office where I than had to wait two days before I could sign for it.

Cosmetically it looks to be in great shape. And yes, the seller offered to send back within the 90 days, but reading reviews where reimbursement was delayed or refused I tried to stick it out. At first was face recognition/software issues upon receipt. Now the phone is having major battery issues. It has an Apple battery in it but it restarts every 5 minutes or less! When I first started using it the battery showed up fine in the health meter and but now it's no longer recognized at all. It's pretty much useless at the point. I think it is a lemon and probably why it was being renewed in the first place. Definitely will go through phone company or apple in the future.
