iphone 12,1,2025-05-30,"Defective Phone. I never leave Amazon reviews but I felt it was necessary to do a review because phones are such expensive products. Around 2 months I bought this refurbished phone. I have always bought refurbished phones or used family members old phones and have never had one last less than a year. This is my first time buying from Amazon and not another website specific to refurbished phones. As of today, this phone is no longer usable . Within one month, the battery life on this phone decreased where I would need to charge when I got home from work (I do not use my phone in my job). This was strange because the battery capacity was listed at 90%. I have had batteries not be as effective of refurbished phones before, but never like this. There also appears to be a spot on the phone where the screen is slightly uneven, despite no drops or other exposures. Again, I have never had this issue before. Within the past two weeks, the phone will randomly drop from 90% to 1% within a span of 20 minutes (not always, just sometimes and often when not in use) and will die. The volume randomly gets loud and quiet and the face id stopped working. Again, these are all issues I have never experienced with any phone I have had. As of today, the phone died (while I was working, after not being picked up even once from 8 AM to 3 PM) and is stuck trying to restart (turning on and off with the white apple logo). Eventually a screen telling me to plug it into restore it appeared, but it will still not restore. My co-worker is convinced it's not even a legit iPhone, though I don't even know if this is true. The seller for my phone is listed as All About Apple and has thus far not been helpful. I do not plan on buying a refurbished phone again from Amazon based on my experience with this seller.",-1,Battery Life & Charging
iphone 12,1,2025-02-10,"POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND DEFECTIVE PHONE WITHOUT ANY RECOURSE. I recently purchased Renewed iphone 12 from SYNERGY TM. I understood that renewed was no indication of perfect but that it was in excellent condition and that it was diagnostically tested. However upon receiving the product and without much use, I realize that it was overheating. I contacted the SYNERGY about this issue and they said I should return which is reasonable on their part. However, this was not reasonable for me, I am an international customer and as such I had to pay over $200 dollars in additional shipping and handling. I communicated the financial disadvantages to SYNERGY and suggest that it would be more economically viable to fix the phone locally and then they could refund me the cost of the repairs. They insisted that I should return but with further insistence they offered me a $25 refund, which would not cover the Technician's fees. By this time, the phone was now not charging all together. I took me about 3 hours before I could get it back to remove my data and reset the phone. I did my research and I was able to get DHL to attempt return the product. New problem is, they were unable to deliver to SYNERGY because their location was closed on a Monday at 12:52 pm and no one sees it fit to respond to my request. I am urging Amazon to look into this matter ASAP. A phone that I bought for $310 is now costing me upwards of $800 and I still don't have a phone to use.",-1,Phone Functionality & Defects
iphone 12,1,2025-06-21,"Selling a damaged iPhone as ""in excellent condition"". This is the 6th USED iPhone that I have purchased during the last 5 years -- the last 3 via Amazon. I only purchase the phone if it is listed as ""in excellent condition"". So far they all were, until this iPhone 12 from ""PRIVI Tech Certified"". It was listed as ""In Excellent Condition"" but when received turned out to be in terrible shape. Having examined so many iPhone before, I can tell that the previous owner of this iPhone 12 did not use a protective case. This is likely why the area around the camera got damaged over time. The damage is so bad that ""PRIVI Tech Certified"" used PAINT to touch-up the damaged areas. The paint job itself is so bad that paint got on the actual glass lens itself (!) SEE PHOTOS. Other damaged areas were PAINTED as well, like the area around the charge port. SEE PHOTOS. This iPhone 12 does not even come close to ""excellent condition"". It is not even in ""acceptable condition"". WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT !!",-1,Screen & Cosmetic Condition
iphone 12,1,2024-11-15,"Not what I expected for “Good” quality.. I ordered this iPhone when my old phone broke. I was excited to be getting a new phone for the first time in a few years. I was upset upon first even receiving the package, because I could feel the phone loose with other items in the package. It was packed loosely in a zip-loc bag with a bubble wrap pocket, and too much room in the box. There was, loose, a charger and sim tool, which the sim tool had ripped the small plastic sleeve it was in and arrived loose in the box. The camera upon inspection has a scratch in the lens going right over the center of the camera. The other camera has gouges around the lens. Around the edges of the phone, it appears to have been dropped multiple times, with gouges out of the corners, not just scratches. There is also a spot on the back where the glass appears to have been chemically etched by a spill of some sort. The spot around the cameras upon arrival was filthy and covered in what appeared to be grime left behind from the previous owners case, since this is a refurbished, “Renewed” phone. There side walls of the phone are flecked with spots of missing paint as if it came into contact with some kind of acetone or paint thinner, which would explain the etched spill mark on the back glass. The protective screen around the microphone also was missing from one of three holes on the bottom, meaning dirt, grime, dust, etc. can all freely blow into the phone. There are also minor scratch marks in and around the charging port, and the charger feels loose inside the port as well. For a refurbished product listed as “Good” quality, I am highly disappointed, as this is not just cosmetic damage. I haven’t even set it up yet, as I will most likely be returning it.",-1,Screen & Cosmetic Condition

iphone 12,1,2023-06-12,"DON'T BUY THIS, FAM! 3-MONTH WARRANTY ON PURPOSE BECAUSE THE PHONE MELTS DOWN AT 6 MONTHS.. Listen. How excited I was to purchase a refurbished iphone promised to be fully functional and the only difference from new being battery life capacity is at 80% instead of 100% - to be expected, and fine. The warranty for this purchase if 3 months or 90 days. Months 1-3, it works fine. 4, 5, battery draining more quickly - doesn't last through the whole day, but I remind myself this is a refurbished phone so it's not perfect. At the start of month 6 - my phone randomly can no longer do Face ID to open the phone. When you try to fix it in Settings, ""Face ID not available at this time"" - is all you get. Then, the right side of the touch screen stops working. Try texting or messaging without m or n or , or ; or p or o. I was out of town so had to delay getting to the apple store to fix it - and week 2, the left side of the touch screen stops working. I had to change my passcode to numbers in the middle of the keypad cuz face ID is gone and the keys on the right and left won't work. When I message and email Amazon and the manufacturer - both are EXTREMELY unhelpful - ""The 90 day warranty has passed so there is nothing we can do"" from the manufacturer and Amazon when this is an Amazon Renewed product. The warranty is at 3 months because the phone starts to melt at 4 months and craps out on you at 6 months. DON'T BUY IT. After returning from the Genius Bar at the Apple store, they told me it would cost $450 (I bought the phone for $453) to fix the touch screen and the face ID - and they were happy to tell me to buy the iphone 13 or 14. If you want to buy refurbished, buy direct from the Apple store - don't buy on Amazon and don't buy Amazon renewed or from this manufacturer. Don't buy this product. UTTERLY disappointing.

iphone 12,1,2024-06-20,"Shady- do not recommend buying a phone here. Very displeased & would not recommend taking a chance on buying a phone here. Specifically ordered an “excellent” condition phone to get the best possible quality but apparently that doesn’t change anything. First of all, phone came damaged with a large impact to the bezel clear as day seen in pictures. That however is the least of my worries. Placed the phone on the charger & charged to 100% before removing from charger so as to not overcharge. Left phone unused overnight with 0 running apps, 0 screen time, roaming off, & no background apps of any sort. Woke up 5 hours later to a 50% battery. Phone was not updating, was not syncing iCloud, nor was anything else running during this 5 hours at all. After waking up I checked the Time on my screen 3 times (that’s it)…..47%……SERIOUSLY?! Made my 1.5 hr drive into work without touching the phone once not even to check the time (again absolutely 0 programs or apps running in background)…..35%?!?! I can only imagine that if I had been actively receiving calls/texts & checking social media once in a while that this battery would last maybe 2 hours at best. It’s clear to me that they must be using fraudulent parts/batteries as battery health score rates at a 91% in phone settings which makes no sense. With a battery like this you are better off buying a corded house phone…I will be giving the seller one opportunity to correct this before taking further action. All evidence posted in pictures of screen time proof & battery degradation. Shame on Amazon for allowing this (even though this is their MO as of late)",-1,Battery Life & Charging

iphone 12,1,2024-09-09,"Read before purchasing!!. Short version: they can sell you a phone that is still connected to a previous carrier and you will have to return it. Long version: Phone gets delivered. Yay new phone. In great condition. Move all my information to new phone. Thank god I didn’t remove everything from old phone. Proceed to switch over phone with carrier and the new phone is still on the previous owners service. So sit on the phone for 2 hours to find out that I have to return it. So, erase all the data I just switched to the phone. Figure out on returning the case and everything I bought to go with the phone(is it even worth doing). Huge hassle. They tell me on the phone that this can happen since it’s an Amazon renewed. Had they said in the description the phone may be on the previous carrier and you won’t be able to use it, I think a lot of people wouldn’t take the chance buying it. So now I got money sitting out there waiting for ups to pick it up and then could take 2 weeks to get to Amazon. Asked for a recording of the convo we had. She said yes. Put on hold then asked why do I need it and then said she will not send it. No compensation, nothing for wasting my time and holding onto my money. (Not $20) Just a really all around bad time for me with nothing in return but a bad taste in my mouth and not even wanting to be an Amazon sheep anymore.",-1,Phone Functionality & Defects
iphone 12,1,2025-05-13,"Bad battery from the start!. This product came to us and looked excellent but just a couple of weeks of having the phone it was evident that there was something wrong with the battery. It would not hold a charge long at all. The phone would shut off and then come back on and 40% of the battery life would immediately drain. The seller approved our return. Unfortunately I dropped the phone and cracked the back of it. Of course, the seller did not accept the return and I don’t blame them, however I am going to give this product a bad review b/c it had a defective battery in this refurbished product from the beginning. I was hoping for a miracle of customer service that they would still accept the phone because of the original issue but I can’t blame them for that.

This review is more so for the condition of the phone and the rating it was given by the seller versus the phone itself, we all know what iPhones do or don’t do. I paid more for the “Excellent” rating or condition. This phone is by no means excellent. Cosmetically there is only one very slight ding on the corner but that means excellent shouldn’t be the term used for the condition of this phone. More so than the ding, the phone is gross. The phone must’ve been owned by someone who wore make up previously Because the speaker on the face of the phone is utterly gross. The silencing switch on the side is also nasty. The phone overheats very easily and severely. The battery capacity is only at 88%. That battery capacity alone should never have let this phone be categorized as excellent.

I immediately came home and started the return process starting january 4th 2024. Today is now February 5th 2024 talk about crushing a little girls feelings selling junk and not taking care of a exchange right away. now i know the company will state ohh it policy for 30 days until we can credit you but that does not sit well with me even worse is my refund will go to amazon credit and i just want to go to a Best Buy and buy my daughter a new phone that works but when ever the refund comes threw i now have to reorder from a new vendor and possibly run into the same situation i did with this seller.

iphone 12,1,2023-01-15,"Amazon Cares Little About Supporting Students. Bought this phone to make the jump to iphone from android. Was impressed at how clean the phone looked and the professional packaging. After setting up the phone I noticed on my first phone call that the speaker had an unusual rattle. The rattle was confirmed and more noticeable while playing music and videos. Not impressed that a phone that supposedly passed a ""20 point inspection"" was allowed to ship with a noticeable rattle from the speaker. Sure the speakers worked but the sound was distorted which was irritating and unexpected. After calling Amazon support to promptly report the issue, the support staff were incredibly understanding and tried to come up with a solution. But, this is my first new phone in 4 years (my previous phone being a refurbished Android bought from Amazon) and I had upgraded after prompting from my carrier to upgrade due to network changes so I can not just reactivate my old phone in the interim. The only recourse the staff could offer was a refund after returning, not even a replacement after I indicated I liked the phone besides the speaker issue. So to end up with the same iphone I have to ship this phone back, wait for a refund, and then reorder the phone from Amazon! Mind you I would also have to either work without a phone (which isn't an option thanks to two step authentication) or go buy a different phone in the interim that I could receive sooner. I am extremely disappointed in Amazon's ability and willingness to support students and the lack of options the support staff were able to offer despite their best efforts. If you are looking for a phone that might ""look"" great but will probably have a noticeable defect then this is the option for you but don't bother trying to receive adequate assistance from Amazon, especially if you are a student because they will leave you high and dry without any satisfactory options.",-1,Phone Functionality & Defects
iphone 12,1,2024-01-03,"DO NOT purchase unless you ENJOY DEFECTIVE PHONES. After setting up the phone and trying to utilize it, we made the terrible discovery that the mic is DEFECTIVE. If we try to make a call, it sounds like we are muted with a ton of static. If we try to record a video or voice message, it sounds like an awful combination of static and being stuck underwater. Imagine making this discovery after you have gone through all the TROUBLE of TRANSFERRING all photos, contacts, apps, etc., from an Android phone. We contacted the seller, and they were COMPLETELY UNHELPFUL. They gave us a series of NO-BRAINER steps to go through (turn the phone off, blow in the mic, etc).

When the phone arrived, it looked ok, but when I attempted to put the screen protector on it the phone screen surface was not flat and the screen protector would not even lay flat against the phone screen. After trying 2 different screen protectors, I realized there was a problem with the phone itself.

At this point I packaged the phone back up and returned it for a replacement phone thinking this was just a one-off item. The second phone I received, I immediately checked if the screen protector would work. Again, the screen protector would not lay flat. I again tested 2 different screen protectors which both had the same result. Examining the second phone, it was again found that the screen was sticking up on two edges, the screen was installed incorrectly. I packed up the second phone and returned the item for a refund.

iphone 12,1,2024-08-08,"Great product horrible customer service. I ordered a blue iPhone 12. It came in great condition, in a timely manner & it is also working great! The reason I’m only giving it 1 star is due to the customer service. I ordered my phone on July 30th. Unknowingly the merchant placed a 10 day hold on my account. On Aug 1st the merchant took the full amount out of my account & did not lift the hold like most merchants do. In return it left my account in the negative due to the hold. So when my direct deposit hit it automatically took the money from it. Which makes it seem like I was charged twice for the same product. Now I’m having to wait 7-14 more days just to get my money back. You don’t know my situation, so that amount could have placed me in a bind. Like I said the product itself is great.

Poor customer service and a poor quality product. If you’re going to price the phone qualities so far apart at least offer the difference when you give someone a low quality product. I should’ve just requested a full refund instead of wasting my time thinking the company would just make it right by compensating for the difference. I won’t be buying from them because of principle.

iphone 12,3,2024-12-17,"Generic battery, ended up needing to replace faceplate within 2 months. I bought my iPhone 12 here in about Oct 15 2024. Then on December 14, almost exactly 2 months later, the audio on the phone app stopped working. Suddenly I was like a mime with a phone. If I did a video call, I'd have to perform interpretive dance. I'm a pretty fair tech geek. After running complete diagnostics at home and at the Apple store, both on the software and hardware, it turned out to be a $250 hardware problem. This was most likely because when the the vendor swapped in a new (non-Apple) battery, they did not seat it correctly. To be fair, iPhone 12's are also known for having phone audio problems (muting audio weirdly.) But after extensive diagnostics, as I said, it did turn out to be a hardware problem. It seems to me that a refurbished phone should work longer than 2 months. And usually, they do. Just not this one. Now, maybe I could have gone to the trouble of returning and replacing this phone, But even if they let me do that, who among us can be phone-less for a week? Even if you bought the insurance coverage, you'd still be out the phone for that long. Normally, I don't mind unplugging on nights or weekends, but I need my phone for work. So, I paid the $250 to Apple to fix it in a couple of hours. You do you, but honestly, until the vendor addresses that problem, I would steer clear, especially if it's an iPhone 12.

iphone 12,3,2023-07-26,"""Premium Renewed"" not quite premium. Pricing lower than Swappa or Backmarket, with Amazon's return policy another plus. Shipping delayed a few days, then delivered to an Amazon ""hub"" rather than my home. I never had anything delivered elsewhere, but maybe that's a new option and I missed it when ordering. Packed in a nice 'Amazon renewed' box that held contents securely, but that box was then just tossed into a much larger generic Amazon box for shipping--no padding, no airbags, etc. Flimsy generic lightning cable included, along with a generic and obviously well used 5w charger (these accessories match what the listing indicated, so no problem). Phone is in generally good cosmetic condition--back and sides seem very good, so was probably in a case; screen though has two distinct scratches toward the bottom. Both are about a half inch long and both are visible at arm's length. The plastic protective sticky sheet over the screen was fine, but the one over the camera lens was too sticky and left residue on the lens that I am unable to get off totally.

However, the Battery Stats shortcut which pulls info from Apple Analytics has more accurate and detailed info. It shows the phone has gone through 320 complete charging cycles and the actual capacity is currently 88.9%. This is slightly below the 90% battery life that Renewed Premium is supposed to have. Overall, with the screen scratches, sticky residue and slightly below advertised battery life, I'd give this iPhone 12 about a 7 out of 10.

These indentations seem to have no affect on the operation (yet to be noticed) but prevent the glass from laying flat with no bubbles. The screen protectors came in a 3 pack so I tried 3 times, same locations. I know doing the same thing multiple time and expecting a different outcome kinda means I’m insane, but oh well.

The phone freezes up even on newest update I have to force stop multiple times even google it just won’t load and it’s not a wifi issue cause I have a 14 n my other daughter has a 12 both bought same time but this one came from this seller n one came from Verizon the Verizon one came like brand new and has not one issue! Also this phone only has a 84% battery life and at 75% it will tell you to get a new one! So won’t last long…so long story short I think I will be returning it and buying from another seller unfortunately my daughter isn’t happy with it.. For the purple one from Verizon!!

Not one scratch scuff no issues what so ever we r so happy with it! My daughter is happy it looks n works amazing! Battery life is 92% and that’s really good for a 12 in used condition!

The phone wouldn't open. It wouldn't recognize my face and it wouldn't recognize the lock code numbers. This happened 2 times and it worked after I let the battery run down and recharged it and I was able to restart it and open it. However the third time, I couldn't seem to run it down. It doesn't help that the iPhone battery level is unreadable. There was an Apple store at a nearby mall. It had a half dozen technicians. The one I got had me do the recommended things like pressing the side buttons and all and it didn't work. So I had to reset it. I noticed that at the other stations, all of the other techs were telling people to reset their phones, too. Resetting loses your unbackedup data like contacts. The apps have to be reloaded too.

It will have a little hiccup or stutter and that was the main reason I wanted to replace my XR. The screen did have damage to it as well. It was small scratches and one small gauge kind of in the screen. I used a screen protector and it concealed the screen marks perfectly without a single air bubble anywhere. Says more about the screen protector than this phone. Sometimes the screen glitches when I try to type something. Even in apps that don’t require internet or any kind of signal for anything. Just the notes section. It’s really frustrating to have a constant reminder that I’m too poor to afford something better. I’ve requested a refund. This phone is only useful if you’re desperate. It’s not worth $200 at all. It’s also slightly smaller than the XR and I don’t like that. I do have a ton of storage though at least. So that’s probably the only real plus. I can have more than just a couple apps and my Spotify downloads don’t kill the storage space. It’s not really a light phone, which is fine to be fair. Feels like it will be harder to drop because it’s like a small weight in your hands. But still I’m sour about the size. You know what, for the annoyance and frustration, I’m doing two stars, it’s just and inconvenience now because it’s like it’s already on its way to the trash. The color is freaking beautiful though. If your on the wild side and don’t use a case, the color lavender or lilac is sure to impress. For $200 I would expect nothing less than a perfectly working phone. This one is literally already starting with the same issues my last phone started having. And look where we are now. I originally was going to return it then I changed my mind and decided to use it.

iphone 12,2,2025-02-28,"Fragile screen. I have bought this phone twice once in blue and another in white, and I must admit I’m not sure whether or not it was worth my money. Overall I adore the functionality of the phone considering it has more storage and is able to run games which my old iPhone 6s couldn’t do, though I feel like the screens on the phones this seller sells are incredibly fragile! First phone arrived with a broken screen which had the corners sticking up ever so slightly from the edges of the phone, and the white phone I bought after getting my refund (which was the first return I had ever done and took overly too long) now has a crack in the screen from falling about a foot into the floor even with a case. The thing that really bothers me about this is the fact my iPhone 6s, which I’ve had much longer than this new yet refurbished iPhone 12, doesn’t have anything broken on it externally at all even though I have similar cases on both phones! Battery health was also significantly degraded at 77%. I didn’t mind the battery health, though it doesn’t quite make the feeling of the crack in my screen any better considering I haven’t had this phone very long. My old iPhone 6s is also refurbished and bought from Walmart, though it honestly feels more durable than what this seller sells. I can’t tell if I just got unlucky twice with Amazon or if there’s something wrong with the phones sold by this seller. Either way, I don’t recommend buying a phone from here and would instead suggest buying directly from Apple. I really wanted to give this a second chance but I’m not sure it was worth the stress of having a phone screen broken twice especially when I could’ve bought something nice for my cats instead. :(",-1,Battery Life & Charging
iphone 12,2,2025-05-19,"Disappointed with Amazon Premium Renewed – Phone Failed in Less Than 2 Months. I purchased an Amazon Premium Renewed iPhone 12 on March 26th, hoping that the higher price and ""premium"" tag would mean better quality and peace of mind. Unfortunately, that was not the case. On May 15th—less than two months later—the phone completely died. It started with a constant reboot loop. The Apple logo just kept flashing, and no soft reset helped. Plugging it into a charger did nothing—it won’t hold a charge, just blinks the logo endlessly. To make matters worse, since day one, the phone made a rattling noise inside—as if something was loose. It didn’t seem to affect performance at first, so I ignored it. In hindsight, it probably was a sign that the phone wasn’t structurally sound. I will say that the seller was responsive and helpful when I reached out, which is why I'm giving two stars instead of one. Still, I’m extremely disappointed in the quality of a product labeled ""Amazon Premium Renewed."" I expected a device that at least lasted beyond 60 days.

Bought iPhone 12 renewed, received and appeared in excellent condition. Transferred info from my phone, working well except on day 1, after completing a call, screen went black, completely unresponsive to all attempts of changing (unable to turn on, off, or get anything else). But, only lasted 1-2 minutes and suddenly came on. Day 4 same black screen occurred after a call, but not resolving. Just sent old phone in as trade-in, obviously unable to call customer svc, went to online chat on my computer, not an easy task but typing all symptoms then waiting for responses, 1st with assistant, then transferred to someone, repeating some of conversation, transferred to someone else; all close to 2 hrs just explaining my issue. During the end of this, the phone suddenly came on, after 4+ hrs of black screen. Have not tried calling anyone but using text and internet options. If happens again, I could lose all phone data - contacts, photos, subscriptions, invoices, - so much we have on there! My options, per emails with customer service, were to contact seller and see what was proposed but no automatic replacement. Main recommendation was to return phone to Amazon and refund expected usually about 30 days, maybe more. I have already sent in my old phone. Before returning this new phone I need to purchase another so I can hopefully still get data transferred. So much for a safe inexpensive option of buying renewed. Will have to spend another several hundred bucks for yet another phone, hoping this damaged one will last long enough to transfer data, And what does that mean as to my trade in? Still don’t have all answers from customer svc. This has not been a great experience, especially since I don’t have a phone I can trust to make any calls, and don’t know what the issue is so am nervous I may lose all data in the phone at any point.

The phone arrived with scratches deep into the metal and what looked like a circular image burned into the upper half of the screen, centered, about the size of a quarter. The screen had a greenish tint, and I couldn't get passed the language selection part of setup. Anyway, it turned out it had some version of iOS on it that was neither factory nor up to date. You'd think any of these issues would have been noticed by a human being before me, right? But anyway, I did manage to get the phone updated with itunes and a computer, and it managed to boot up. The camera is blurry and bright, the backlight is only randomly functional, and it's all so very green looking.

iphone 12,2,2024-03-11,"Disappointed. We purchased a phone for my daughter which worked fine for the first few months. Then, we found out that my daughter had cracked it on accident and we brought it to a shop to get it fixed. My daughter had complained of the battery but our time frame had expired so we could not reach out to this vendor. We mentioned this issue as well to the shop we brought the phone to fix the crack. They let us know that the battery the phone came with was defective and that there were glass pieces left from previous repairs. This has left a bad experience for us as we basically had to invest what we paid for the phone to get it repairs. Ended spending more and the phone did not last a year.

iphone 12,4,2024-10-05,"Good Working Condition. This product is an Apple iPhone 12 with 256 GB of storage, fully unlocked and tested to work seamlessly on both Verizon and T-Mobile/Metro networks. The phone boasts an improved camera system with AI-driven enhancements, capturing stunning 4K video. Compared to my previous iPhone SE, the iPhone 12 delivers noticeably sharper and superior video quality. Although the phone arrived later than expected, I'm pleased with the purchase overall. This is the third phone I've bought through Amazon, and the first one that worked as expected. The first two were not authorized for service in the USA. Based on my experience, I recommend Amazon’s Renewed cell phone program for those looking to reduce waste by recycling and reusing electronics. However, the phone arrived with a few dents and messy adhesive, which took some effort to clean off using rubbing alcohol. Shipping could have been faster, and I experienced a delay of about a week and a half before receiving the phone. I also wish Amazon would disclose the seller associated with your purchase before you buy, as some sellers provide better products than others. Fortunately, this particular seller did a great job renewing the phone. The 256 GB of storage is a huge plus, leaving me with about 64 GB free after setup. It also came with a charger cable, but unfortunately, there was no official product manual, AirPods, or original box included. If you don’t mind waiting and a bit of uncertainty, Amazon’s renewed phones tend to work out well thanks to their generous guarantee and return policy. It would be great, however, if refunds for defective purchases were processed more quickly. Lastly, Siri on this model feels different compared to my iPhone SE, likely because I don’t have the hardware needed to take full advantage of the new Apple Intelligence features on this device.

I don't know what it is, but it's very odd and at times interferes with some of the ways I use the device. I opted not to return it because other people I know who have this version of iPhone said their phone did that at some point too and they either ignored it or they updated their device and the problem resolved itself. I had to remember that this is a used handset and this issue with how it handles black is literally one of two faults that the item has. The vender was pretty meticulous with support, packaging, instructions, and they even included a new charger in the box that works very well and is a bit thicker than the OEM parts so it's still in good shape too.

iphone 12,4,2024-02-27,"Highly Recommend. I am a 19 year old broke college student, but I have had the Iphone XR since my freshman year of highschool... I am a rising junior now. Though my XR did my well over the years, she recently started shutting off on me at random times, would die after 30 minutes of use after being charged fully. I was just wayyyy past due for a new phone, so I got this one. This was one of my first big girl purchases, so I was a little worried that something was going to be wrong with the phone, seeing as I saw quite a few reviews complaining of issues with their phones, but I haven't had any problems yet. Face ID works perfectly, extremely minor scratches (so unnoticeable I was only able to tell because I was strictly looking for them), easy to switch over to my carrier (literally just inserted the old sim card, and 30 minutes later EVERYTHING transferred over with no issues). Honestly, this is a REALLY good deal if you're looking for a more cheap route than having to buy a phone straight from Apple. Now, the only issue, which I dont fully see as an issue and youll understand why but the battery. The biggest issue with my old phone was how quickly it died. It was impossible to go out for longer than 3 hours without my phone dying. The first setting I checked on the new phone was the battery capacity, and although I was really really upset when I saw it was also at 80% like my last phone, I dont really know if that number is fully true. I recieved my phone yesterday, and havent charged it since the afternoon of that day, and it is still on 49% which would NEVER happen with my old phone. SO, I put the rating down one star because it does still say that the battery capacity is 80%, but I just havent really seen that as of yet! Hope you guys found my review useful, and I highly HIGHLY recommend buying this product. Just make sure to double-check the ratings of the seller you're buying from. For me, the black color of the iPhone 12 came from a different buyer than the blue color. The black phone color seller has 3.2-star ratings while the blue phone seller has a 4.5-star rating, so I went with a color I wouldn't have usually gone with to higher my chances of receiving a phone in better condition!",-1,Battery Life & Charging

Here’s a breakdown of my thoughts: Performance: The A14 Bionic chip delivers impressive performance. Everything from browsing to gaming has been smooth and responsive. I’m glad I chose this model—I can easily multitask without any noticeable lag. Condition: The phone arrived in good condition overall, with minimal signs of wear. However, I did notice a few light scratches on the screen that weren’t mentioned in the description. While they don’t impact functionality, it was a bit disappointing. Camera Quality: The camera takes fantastic photos, and the Night Mode feature is a game-changer. I love capturing memories, and this phone does an excellent job, even in tricky lighting situations. Battery Life: The battery life is decent but could be better. I find myself needing to charge it by the end of the day, especially with heavy usage. It’s not a dealbreaker, but I was expecting a bit more endurance. Value for Money: Considering the savings compared to a brand-new device, this refurbished iPhone 12 offers great value. For anyone on a budget, it’s a solid option. In summary, I highly recommend the refurbished iPhone 12 for anyone looking for a reliable smartphone.

iphone 12,4,2023-05-10,"Excellent condition with good enough battery health. [My review contains 6 photos] [My review rating actually is 4.5 stars.] My interest in purchasing an Amazon Renewed iPhone 12 (2020) arose from favorable past experiences with renewed (used) purchases, and a more affordable opportunity to upgrade a first gen iPhone SE (2016). My order was placed on March 31, 2023, and it arrived on May 4, 2023. The unboxing experience was excellent. An unadorned white cardboard box labeled ""Amazon Renewed"" on the top and some device info on the back. Inside, side-by-side, two recessed trays, one for the iPhone (covered by a clear plastic film) and the second for a USB 5V power adapter and 3' Lightning cable. A ""OPEN ME FIRST"" sleeve with several cards inside: HI THERE, WE'VE GOT YOU COVERED, QUICK START GUIDE, SIM REMOVAL TOOL, and INSPECTION TEST CERTIFICATE. Cosmetically the phone looked brand new. No noticeable blemishes (just a tiny scratch near the Lightning connection). So, after powering on and setting up the iPhone 12, I checked a few things. WiFi and Bluetooth were okay. Face ID okay. The battery was at 81% charge, with a Max Capacity (Battery Health) of 89%. iOS was at version 16.3.1, which I upgraded to 16.4.1, then 16.4.1(a). The back of the box noted ""BH 91%"" and the Inspection Certificate noted that ""Your Device"" – A2172 BH91 – was ""Tested in New Jersey"" on 03/24/2023"" and ""Battery Health 90%+ confirmed."" So, in the time (~6 weeks) between inspection and arrival, this iPhone lost 2% of max battery capacity. Is this typical (as in other reviews)? Is this a big deal? Well, in my case 89% BH probably is good enough. The renewed iPhone 12 is not my primary smartphone. And the fully charged battery lasts longer than my old iPhone SE's. And the 12 has the latest iOS and other more recent hardware and software features (like MagSafe, Precision Finding). The Amazon Renewed Guarantee includes replacement or refund within 1 year of replacement. That's a plus.",-1,Screen & Cosmetic Condition

iphone 12,4,2024-09-09,Everything you want in an iPhone. I took very seriously my approach to buying an iPhone i researched all the different refurbished models on Amazon and I went online to various search engines looking for other reviews on potential iPhones. I even weighed the benefits of buying used versus new. I made my choice with this iPhone 12 and even paid an extra $10 to have it delivered sooner. When it got here I was very impressed as it had 100% battery life left. The transfer from my old iPhone took a while due to the fact it first had to be updated to the latest iOS version. After the update everything else was simple. But here's the problem. The Wi-Fi icon grayed out after 2 days leaving the phone unable to connect to the internet. I did hours of research looking at 10 different fixes and tried them all three or four different times. None of them worked and most reviewers who addressed this problem said if the fixes don't work it is probably a hardware problem with probably the internal antenna and that needed to be fixed by an authorized iPhone repair shop or someone else who knows what they're doing. That wasn't going to happen so I unfortunately had to send the phone back.,-1,Phone Functionality & Defects

Unfortunately the battery life is not the greatest. The pixel I could use for two days without charging. This iPhone, I end up having to charge after dinner time. And I don’t use it that much. Like I said you take your chances when getting a refurbished item. So I will be taking a rechargeable device with me when going on longer trips..

iphone 12,4,2022-10-17,"Got one with 100% Battery Health, minor scratching on back. Update January 2024: Still running perfectly fine, no lag or anything when using. The battery health has gone down to 89% after a little over a year of having it. Granted, I have a habit of overcharging my phone overnight when I’m asleep so that may be the cause. I still highly recommend this phone in 2024. Update February 2023: I still have the phone and the battery health is still at 100%. The phone is still working fine and I haven’t noticed any slow downs yet. I don’t regret this purchase! I believe I got lucky and got what feels like a brand new iPhone 12. I know the phone is old and I really am under the impression I got a brand new one that was sitting around for a while. Everything works fine and I’m really happy that when checking the battery health, it said 100%! I checked under direct light for scratches and scuffs. There was some minor scratches; very thin which looks like finger nail scratches. But from arm lengths distance, I couldn’t make out where the scratches were and I’m happy with it. My Samsung Galaxy S10e of 2.5 years malfunctioned recently and I needed a new phone but I didn’t want to break the bank. I did a lot of research prior to purchase on which older model was more “bang for your buck.” I found that the iPhone 12 in 2022 was a worthy purchase considering it has a great camera, pretty display and the potential to see several more years of support from Apple (support being firmware updates which tend to include new features to your phone’s software). Nothing is guaranteed but a lot of people mentioned much older iPhones are still receiving updates. I do have a case on it but I don’t prefer any screen protectors because I want the most out of the display. If I break it, my carrier will fix it for a low cost. From now on, I’m going to buy older models of phones to save money and hope I get a quality phone like this one!",-1,Battery Life & Charging

I'm guessing that it lived in a quality case, upon arrival and inspection I placed it in one right away. The phone works perfectly, I'm a little worried about the battery strength and lasting power. I do play my music constantly so that might be a problem. We will see and I will update but right now I'm extremely happy. Now that I have had the phone for a while I feel ready to give it a more complete review. I'm still very happy that I saved money with the acceptable version. The battery is still a concern as there are times when it does seem to discharge faster than I think that it should, but it has never left me stranded. The front glass seems to have been replaced by a lesser quality glass as I do have issues reading my fingertips sometimes in comparison to previous iPhones. Again this is an inconvenience not a serious problem. Overall I'm really happy with the phone a so glad to have an iPhone again. I really hated the Android's that I have had to use over the last couple of years. I use this this phone with mint moble and I have been very happy with the quality of service and calls from both mint moble and my phone.

While only 3% from being true, it is also only 2% away from 75%, with a quarter of battery life used. Guess it depends on how one looks at it. Either way, its not 80%. That was a big sales point for myself, as this phone was intended to be a gift for one of my sons, who is currently having issues with his current battery in his current older model iPhone.

I checked out all the lenses, flash, speakers and everything else, but I forgot to make a phone call because I had to go to att and get a new sim since I was transferring from a 6s +. The headphone speaker was messed up as I found out like 9 days later when I could only talk on speaker during calls. Battery health was at 82% but it EASILY lasts a full day plus, even with heavy use. I ordered a new one before I sent the first one back and there were a few scratches on the top right, but my case covers it up now. Phone had no issues besides a little dust/dirt in the speaker and mic holes, but you can use a wooden toothpicks to gently clean those out. Got everything switched over and sent the other phone back. Battery health on this one was 88%. Overall, purchase was great - just make sure to double-check everything before the 90 days is up so you can replace it if needed. It feels better in my hand with a case and I added a glass screen protector. CHECKLIST: Proximity sensor while on a call, open up a white board website and make sure the whole screen functions correctly by coloring every inch, ear speaker and bottom speaker, mic, connectivity to your phone service and to your wireless, silent/sound rocker on the left side halfway up, make sure all the buttons press in cleanly and make sure there, check the flash by using flashlight or taking photos and be sure to shine a light on the camera lenses to make sure there are no scratches.

No issues with the side buttons or either camera. My only real “gripe” with this phone is the battery health, which is at 78%. I would have thought excellent condition would have gotten me somewhere in the 80% range. That being said, it’s a back up phone so I don’t have it in constant use. For someone who was using it as their main phone, the battery drain would be a major issue. It does charge pretty fast and no issues with the charging port.

iphone 12 mini,4,2025-07-13,"Great Little Phone with a Fantastic Camera, But Battery Life Drains a Little Too Fast. I've had my Apple iPhone 12 mini in the beautiful mint green color, and overall, it's been a great little phone. The camera has been consistently good, capturing clear and vibrant photos and videos, which I really appreciate. From the moment I got it, there were no visible defects. It felt and looked premium. I also absolutely loved the size of this phone; it's so comfortable to hold and use with one hand, fitting easily into any pocket. Plus, it came with plenty of storage, so I've never had to worry about running out of space for my apps and photos. My main frustration, however, is that the battery seems to run out very quickly, especially since I first got it. It struggles to last a full day with moderate use, and I often find myself needing to charge it much sooner than I'd like. This has become a noticeable issue over time. Despite the battery life, the compact design, excellent camera, and ample storage still make it a solid choice. It's a fantastic phone if you prioritize a smaller form factor, but be prepared to keep a charger handy. Works exactly as I needed it to.

Another nice bonus: I had multiple color options to choose from, which isn’t always the case with refurbished phones. The only downside I’ve noticed is that the battery doesn’t hold a charge as long as a brand-new phone, but it’s still more than usable for a full day with moderate use.

The size is one of the biggest selling points for me. It's lightweight and fits comfortably in my pocket, yet it delivers the same powerful performance as larger iPhones. The screen is sharp and bright, and everything from scrolling to switching between apps is smooth and fast, thanks to the A14 Bionic chip. Even though it’s a smaller phone, the camera quality is excellent. Photos come out crisp and clear, and it handles low light better than I expected. Battery life is solid too—I get a full day on a single charge with regular use. The fact that it’s unlocked gave me the freedom to use it with my current carrier without any hassle.

iphone 12 mini,4,2024-05-14,"A great phone, though no replacement for my Iphone SE (1st Generation). This is a brilliant phone. Yes, it is a few generations down from the newest, and yes these are specifically refurbished as well. Even so! My phone arrived in basically new condition a year ago, and has worked well since. Battery life is...not amazing, but Iphones honestly don't have great battery life. They'll last you through the day depending on your use, but not much past that. That's fine, I charge mine often. 64GB's is plenty for a phone unless you are recording often and keeping a large gallery or a ton of apps. I like the smaller size of the phone, I think phones are getting too big, and this has all the features of a big phone in the smaller package. I like the facial recognition (although it feels dystopian) as it makes unlocking the phone a breeze. I think the camera is very passable, and I like the screen. If not for being worried about dropping it, the outer case is beautiful. Apple outdid themselves. What I don't like. The size...is actually still a bit too big for me. The Iphone SE (1st Generation) used the Iphone 5 frame. I thought that frame was truly amazing, as it wasn't very big at all. Easy to one hand, almost as if designed to be. It in fact *WAS* designed to be. When I first got it, I realized this. It is too big to one hand comfortably, it's not quite so big that 2 hands feels truly right. It's fine, but I feel the mini should have been actually a touch smaller. Also, I honestly kinda dislike having almost all the phone's front be the screen. There's nowhere good to rest your hand to support it without touching the screen. I used to wrap my hand around the phone and support it with my thumb across the front, near where the button was. It's a nitpick, but I just don't dig it as much. For $200~275 though, is it worth it? Ab-so-lutely. It's a great phone, I bought mine I think for near double that, and I only somewhat regretted the price tag. It's held up very nice the past year, and I don't expect to have to replace it for a good number. If not for the busted screen on my old phone, I'd still be rocking it despite a truly not good battery.

Am pleased with the quality of the renewed device; it came with barely a scratch, maybe a little rubbing on one edge but not noticeable with the Otter case on it. No scratches or flaws on the face glass. The battery shows 85% capacity which I was disappointed about at first but seems to be better than what many other reviewers are reporting.

iphone 12 mini,4,2024-08-09,"iPhone 12 Mini, 128 GB. Scratch resistant: The phone by itself can easily get scratched on the sides and just one drop itself can leave a noticeable scratch/mark if you drop it somewhere like the street or crossroad by accident. Screen: The screen feels very smooth if you are upgrading from something less newer. Easy to play games on if you have small hands as well as type. I recommend a screen protector cause every iPhone to ever exist is easy to get scratches without you even noticing. Battery: My phone came with 87% battery health and I was fine with it until within just a week or so it went down to 85%. That’s my only real problem with this phone. Camera: The quality is amazing so if you take pictures this will satisfy most of your needs. It’s definitely more than worth it if you’re looking to upgrade to something better or newer. Appearance: I personally got the red color and it looks amazing and brand new. The phone comes in a box with a SIM card opener pin, charger without cube, paper with information about the phone and seller, and the phone is inside a little bag. **Although it might not be important but if you for example get the 128 GB and you have the latest IOS update that means you’ll have 10GB less due to the software.

I think the only problem I have with it is the battery - I mean, even the phone as new has a battery capacity of about 2200mAh - so this one with 86% battery life wasn’t expected to do much. A full charge lasts for about 6 hours if you only browse the internet (on WiFi), play music and watch videos. But once you are on a video call, a full charge will only last for about 1.5 hours.

Once I got the phone powered on and switched on with my carrier, I noticed the battery health was at 85%. This is lower than I was expecting, but it wasn’t a dealbreaker. I have used the phone vigorously and to my surprise, it has held up quite well. I do have to leave the Power Saver on for the battery life to last me throughout the day. I know this isn’t normal for an iPhone, but for being an old-ish model and since I am used to using a cheap android that has terrible battery life, I don’t mind having to charge it throughout the day.

The advertisement guaranteed 80% or more so it did met its minimum as stated, but of course hoped for better (especially since this model isn't known for the longest battery life even when new). Would I do it again? = Probably. Should you do it? = not sure as every used iPhone is used and has a unique history of use and abuse and every refurbishment is done just enough to get unit up to minimum specifications so one used phone may not be fully indicative of what another is. If you get a dud you'd probably realize it soon and be able to erase and return.

I purchased this iPhone 12 mini as an upgrade for my iPhone SE, which was running out of storage and having difficulty taking photos at night. I have to say, the 12 Mini is an upgrade in almost every possible way. The LED display makes my video games and pictures look so much better, and the A14 processor drops fewer frames. Not to mention reliable and fast 5G connection. My particular example, however, fell a little short of my hopes (though it did meet my expectations). The product descriptions for renewed products specify that the phone will arrive with a battery health of at least 80%, and no visible defects when held at arms' length. My phone has exactly 80% battery health, and a number of scuffs on the outer aluminum frame, which, as described, are not visible at arms' length. As a result, the battery life is actually slightly worse than my SE, and I decided not to get a clear case, so the scuffs wouldn't show at all. Nothing deal-breaking, but just a little reminder that the phone *is* used, so set your expectations and read the description.

Saw the history of the parts, it is a Genuine Apple Part which is great.

However I know how important it was for me to see real reliable reviews so here it is… This review is going to be about the quality of product they sent me. Not the phone itself but I will cover that too. First impressions, Came very poorly packaged. I was really worried the phone was going to be broken or just horrible. The phone was only protected by a small box. The phone was loose in the box and it was only protected by a bit of bubble wrap. I took the phone out and immediately I wasn’t impressed. The phone was dirty like really dirty. I took about 5 minutes of wiping it down until I was satisfied. Then I noticed the scratches… there’s a huge scratch in the front near the camera and a couple more scratches in the back of the phone. This is a huge turn off for me because scratches really annoy me. Battery life was full capacity 100%. Phone itself ran beautifully. If your considering buying the 12 mini I’d highly recommend it! I wouldn't buy it renewed from Amazon if get it brand new. It’s worth spending the extra $100 for a new product. The size is great. If your coming from any iPhone 6,7,8 SE then the size of the phone is very comfortable. Battery life is amazing. I’m a intense user and the majority of reviews on the battery are false.

About the seller and condition of the phone (refurbished - Good condition - 128gb): -The supplier was Big Box LLC, which has a 4.6 star rating right now- A few dents and scratches on the sides of the phone, more than what is described by amazon, they're pretty visible but it's not a problem, can't see them with a case on. The screen and cameras are intact. No third party replacements according to the about section in settings. Battery came with 82% which kinda sucks because it lasts for about 4hrs of screen-on-time on normal usage, and replacing it through apple costs about $70. All in all i'm satisfied with amazon refurbished and this seller, I got a good price for this phone ($350 for the 128gb version, vs $489 on apple.com/refurbished, though it does comes with a new battery and outer casing) About the phone itself: Its an amazing phone, there really isn't a noticeable difference between it and the newest iphones (excluding battery life), and its stupidly faster and better than my previous iphone 6s and LG G6.

iphone 12 mini,4,2022-02-12,"Tampered with — made in 1978. Phone looks brand new, not a single scratch, and 100% battery health. But weird things have been happening. First, I couldn’t activate this phone with my career’s online tool— one where you log into your account and enter the phone’s IMEI. This has worked fine with all my previous phones. I had to call customer support for a specia activation process. Then, I noticed there were location services options missing on this device, specifically the Find My feature, and sharing my location in iMessages, which I use in my family group. When I say missing I mean certain buttons simply aren’t on my screen while they show up on another phone running the same iOS version. The last straw was when I logged into my account on Apple support and this phone shows an impossible manufacturer date of 1978. See screenshot. I’ve read that this is done by Apple to identify “gray market” devices, devices refurbished by unauthorized resellers, and iPhones that were demo units. This makes me wary that this phone may have been tampered with, compromised, or hacked. Like I said it is cosmetically in perfect condition, I was even impressed!

I tried changing settings, but still bothersome, especially around the edges. After warranty was out, several issues began with the battery. The first month or so, it required charging twice a day, with or without excessive use. I liked the size so much and the fact text messaging was a breeze, I tolerated it. December 2024- Then the battery began getting really hot. The touchscreen stopped responding. I removed the cover and even took the screen protector off (I was panicking)! I forced it to power down. After powering up again, I ran it in low power mode, which seemed to help and kept the phone functional. January 2025 - The phone would say it wasn’t charged, plug in and it indicated 70 - 89% charged; unplug, 2 -3%. Phone gave a message: Battery not recognized. Look in explanation, the battery is not Apple and may be incompatible. Next day, thankfully, it upgrades. Since then, screen sensitivity is much better and the battery seems ok. It doesn’t need charging as often. I just really enjoy that text messages are sent and received so easily and I don’t feel like I’m carrying around a mammoth of a phone. It also seems faster on the internet. Those are the reasons that I gave 2 stars. Also, it’s in a case and the screen has several cracks, from low level drops. This might be an Apple issue. The only other electronic device that I own that has cracked, is an iPad. No cracks on any of my android refurbished phones. In fact, I still have two around the house to use for shopping, internet searches, etc. This may just be the “luck of the draw” and I just happened to get a lemon.

I don't think it is a mechanical issue, as it actually will focus properly and then get blurry a milisecond later. It seems more like a software issue / perhaps planned obsolescence.

iphone 12 mini,2,2025-04-22,"Disappointed with the build quality. I received the phone promptly, and at first glance, it seemed to be in perfect condition. However, after a few days of use, I noticed that the screen on the right side is slightly popping out. It becomes especially noticeable when pressing along the edges. Upon closer inspection, it seems the screen may have been replaced but was not properly adhered to the frame. Very disappointing given its price point. On the other hand, functionality and battery are as expected. I would recommend this if the build quality did not have such issues (scratches would have been much more welcome!), but given the product I received, which was apparently in ""Excellent"" condition, I'd suggest you stay away.",-1,Screen & Cosmetic Condition
iphone 12 mini,2,2024-06-18,"Used iPhone 12 Mini. I recently purchased an iPhone 12 Mini, and I have a few thoughts to share based on my experience. First and foremost, it's important to note that my unit had a replacement screen. While the screen works fine, I can’t help but wonder if it impacts the phone's overall performance and longevity. One of the most common complaints I read in other reviews was about the battery life, and I have to agree. The battery doesn't last as long as I hoped. Even with moderate use, I find myself needing to charge it more frequently than my previous phones. For a device that promises portability and convenience, having to carry a charger around somewhat defeats the purpose. Additionally, I noticed that the phone had a few scratches on the body when I received it. While these are mostly cosmetic issues, they were disappointing to see on a relatively new device. It's something to keep in mind if you're considering purchasing a refurbished or pre-owned model. In summary, while the iPhone 12 Mini is compact and offers the usual Apple quality in terms of user experience, the battery life and the condition of the phone I received were letdowns. If battery longevity and pristine condition are important to you, you might want to consider other options or ensure you buy from a reputable source that guarantees the condition of the device. I ended up returning the phone.",-1,Battery Life & Charging

iphone 12 mini,2,2025-01-30,"Be careful with your purchase. Let me preface this by saying that some of this is on me for not verifying my purchase. I purchased a phone from amazon (amazon renewed) in May of 2024 to use for developing a new app. I did not (at that time) need to connect it to a cellular network, so I did not. On that front the phone is great: fully functional, great physical shape, and the settings showed that it was carrier unlocked, as expected. January of 2024, I'm at a point where it does need service, and after several days and efforts, I find that while it's unlocked, it only works on T-mobile's network. So not what I wanted, not what I was expecting, and not what I paid for. However, I should have checked half a year ago during the return window. It's a learning experience.

iphone 12 mini,2,2023-07-09,"Manage your expectations with this purchase. I was hesitant to purchase a renewed iPhone, but I was not interested in purchasing a new iPhone with so many affordable devices available for reuse. I understood that with the purchase of a used device that there would be typical wear and tear associated with use and I was not expecting a pristine condition phone by any means. I purchased the “Excellent condition” option available for the product. This option provided several assurances: 1) The screen would be free of scratches. 2) the body would have no signs of cosmetic damage visible within 12 inches and 3) the battery would be fully functional and above 80% battery life. I did not receive that product. The screen had a substantial and tangible scratch across the lower half of the screen. I thought it was strange the iPhone came with a screen protector already installed, but I suspect this was placed to cover the deep scratch below. The camera plate around the rear camera lens was covered in visible scratches and dents around the bezel of lenses. Functionally, the phone was in good condition. The battery life is at 84%. There does not seem to be anything electronically or mechanically wrong with the device. The camera works great and there does not appear to be any internal problems with the iOS or processor. If I had received this product with purchase under “Acceptable condition”, then I imagine be happier with the purchase. I wanted to try to refund/replace the item, but I really could not afford to be without a phone through the refund process, so I decided to keep the device.

After doing some googling I found out that there was nothing much anyone could do about it and that it was probably a stolen phone or a phone that someone sold to the refurbishing place without paying the total.

I’ve been through four of these phones in a couple months, and they have all had major issues from Camera not working to audio issues, and the worst of all one COMPLETELY DIED after four months. Unfortunately, the Amazon warranty is only three months. (I thought it was one year because other competitors offer that. But it does clearly say on their page that it’s only three months.) During these three months, they to completely refund you no problem or fix the issue that you report. But unfortunately the phone I kept died on month four, while I was on vacation to make matters worse. Seems like the sellers are always different stores, but all amazon approved and they follow some sort of Amazon standards for these phones. But it seems to me that these phones have really severe issues so these Amazon sellers fix the phones to a certain standard, but they are not in good condition. All the sellers are polite and responsive, but the issue is the actual phones and their conditions. Even though these phones are used, they are not cheap, they should function properly. I’ve been an Amazon customer for years and I really haven’t had any issue with them. That was the reason why I decided to buy the used phone on Amazon instead of a competitor. But this is truly disappointing to the point that I think I’m going to report them to the Better Business Bureau. They should not be selling phones in this condition. FULL STORY Phone 1: iPhone 12 mini (Ordered good condition ) Received Mid October Seller: Kojak sales When I receive the phone physically it seems fine. But as soon as I put a case on it, a lot of little pieces of paint started coming off of it and then you could tell it had a lot of scratches on the case so somebody was trying to cover the scratches, then I put a screen protector on it, and after trying to I could not get rid of a humongous huge bubble, took a third of the screen. So some thing was hinting to me that the screen was not straight. In my opinion, the phone shouldn’t have been sold as good condition with so many scratches but since I don’t care about the look as much as functionality, I move forward. But then, after a few weeks of using the phone, I realized things were not working properly. The camera was very slow at taking pictures if it was dark or if you were using inside the message or WhatsApp. Also, if I received a text while listening to videos or video calls, the speaker would suddenly gets super low, and I could barely hear the video for about two minutes . (usually this lowering of audio feature happens only for five or 10 seconds). This was worrying me so I contacted the seller and told him I wanted to change the phone and he said no problem. Since I was still thinking that this was bad luck, but in general, I liked the iPhone 12 I decided to buy another phone as a replacement, and one more phone as a Christmas gift. I’ll explain below the problems with those phones, but since the problems were actually worse than the current first phone I had in my possession, I never gave back this phone. I kept thinking that maybe the issues would get better with update and also, in my mind, I thought I had a year warranty. Unfortunately, in February while away on vacation the phone one morning, simply never turned on again. My dad is an engineer and he tried helping me connect it to computer and nothing it’s like the battery is no longer connected. I’m sure you can imagine the horrendous time I had the following week without my phone., traveling.. Things got worse when I got home and was able to contact the seller. I then discovered the warranty was only 90 days and that date had passed. After some back-and-forth the seller Kojak sales said they can fix it for $39 and I pay for shipping. I have still not done this since I’m skeptical and don’t understand how they can give me a price if they don’t even know the actual problem or if they need parts. But I really have no other option, or I lose $241 or I pay $60 more. (also, I have to figure out how to erase the phone from a PC if the phone doesn’t even turn on.

iphone 12 mini,1,2024-08-15,"I'm very disappointed.. I ordered this phone because my old iPhone 8 finally decided to kick the bucket. It didn't die exactly but the battery started swelling. And then I found out it was at risk of blowing up in my face. Literally. Naturally I needed a new phone ASAP so I could transfer all the data from my old phone before it went off like a bomb. I didn't want to pay a ton of money for a new phone, I don't mind pre-owned stuff, and I like giving things a new life. So I got this. After the order being delayed several times my new (to me) iPhone finally arrived. I opened the package and was surprised to see that the phone was black; not red as it said it was. I was slightly taken aback but I was fine with a different color especially since I didn't want the hassle of returning it and ordering a new one. Not what was advertised but not a huge deal. I then began to transfer the data from old phone to new. When it was all set up and ready for use I opened the camera to see how much better it was then my iPhone 8's, only to see that it was as bad if not WORSE and it made a terrifying buzzing noise while trying to focus, which it couldn't. I was now certain I needed to return it, but just for funsies I decided to check the battery health. It was at 75% (below the guaranteed level) and said it needed servicing. I just returned the phone. This is more a review for the seller (Wireless Source) than it is for the general refurbished iPhone 12 mini as I know there are many different sellers selling the same product and quality varies quite a lot. I'd really like to give them the benefit of the doubt because it totally could have been just a fluke, but I won't ever feel confidant enough to order from that seller again. A word of advice. If you are buying a refurbished phone check the seller's rating over the past 12 months by clicking on 'Sold By: Whoever'. It could save you from a bad experience.

iphone 12 mini,1,2024-01-11,"FIND A DIFFERENT SELLER - MODEL OF PHONE IS GREAT. My best review advice is find another seller, because sometimes spending some extra money from a different seller might be worth it, because I will be spending $178 more. So I have two children and wanted to upgrade their phones. Being that they are kids I got them renewed phones. I got the phones in. They are supposed to have 80% of the original battery health life. They used it to stream audio for 4 hours and they were then down to 20%. No video, no other applications going. Even if you doubled the 4 hours you would still be only barely making the lowest estimate. I messaged the sellers. They offered to refund, replace, or give me a $15 credit so -I- could go get the batteries replaced. Both phones had the problem so replacement didn't seem wise. Refunding would leave me with my kids not having a phone until I got them replacements because I had already recycled their old ones. Oh, and the battery replacement is $89 - EACH... to use the warranty it would cost me $39 (each) - on a week old phone... So I thought ask for the $39 and pay the difference out of pocket since insurance would laugh at me doing a claim with a WEEK OLD EXCELLENT CONDITION PHONE. They might even cancel my plan for fraud. The seller said no, and reminded me I could simply return or replace them. I could, but then my kids wouldn't have communications for an unknown amount of time and for their safety I found that unacceptable. MAYBE the phone you get will be better - I got two with the same problem. MAYBE you won't need to use the warranty - I wouldn't think you would have to even consider it the first week.... the phones LOOK pretty, no scratches or screen cracks or whatever - and when I called them on the whole battery thing they DID fulfill their requirements for Amazon A to Z - but sometimes doing only what is requirred isn't kosher / right given the situation... and I was stupid enough to recycle their old phones so quickly... just know that sometimes spending some extra money from a different seller might be worth it, because I will be spending $178 more.

I purchased a refurbished phone from this seller and only discovered after setup and an Apple diagnostic that it had a non-genuine replacement camera.

When I contacted the seller, they offered a minimal $30 refund and denied any responsibility for disclosing the issue. Even more concerning, they explicitly stated they have no obligation to disclose non-original parts in their product listings—that it is amazon's responsibility. Unfortunately, I will now need to spend an additional $100 out of pocket to replace the camera with a genuine part in order to restore full functionality and Apple support along with trade-in value. This kind of lack of transparency is unacceptable, especially when selling refurbished devices. Non-original parts that impact performance and value should be clearly disclosed.

iphone 12 mini,1,2023-06-26,"Worst scam ever!. I recently purchased a phone and to say that I am utterly disappointed would be an understatement. The moment the return date expired, the battery of this phone mysteriously stopped working, rendering it completely useless. It's truly disheartening to experience such a malfunction after only a week of usage after return date has passed. The final blow came when the battery completely died and refused to charge, no matter what I tried. I attempted different charging cables, wall adapters, and even tried charging it from my laptop, but the phone remained lifeless. As a consumer, I expect reliability and quality from the products I purchase, especially when they come with positive reviews and reputable branding. However, this particular phone failed to meet even the most basic expectations. It not only failed in terms of performance but also fell short in terms of durability and longevity. Moreover, the timing of this battery failure seems highly suspicious. It is incredibly frustrating that the issue manifested itself just after the return date had passed. It raises questions about the quality control and the integrity of the product itself. I am left wondering if this was a deliberate ploy to ensure customers are left with defective products beyond the return window. I must emphasize my profound disappointment and advise potential buyers to exercise caution before purchasing this particular phone. While it may initially appear appealing and have decent features, the lack of reliability and the unpleasant customer experience I encountered cannot be ignored. I sincerely hope that others will be spared the frustration and inconvenience that I have endured. I have reached out to Amazon's customer service regarding this matter, hoping for a resolution. However, based on this experience, my trust in the brand has been significantly diminished. I will be considering alternative options in the future to avoid a repeat of this ordeal. In conclusion, my recent phone purchase has left me feeling disgusted and thoroughly dissatisfied. The untimely failure of the battery, just after the return date had expired, raises serious concerns about the product's quality and the overall experience provided. It is regrettable that what seemed like a promising investment turned into a waste of both time and money.",-1,Phone Functionality & Defects

The phone edges were painted using cheap pain that has already begun to chip off right out of the package upon phone setup up.. this is down right despicable and terrible, terrible business practice. Also the screen experiences severe glitching when scrolling, and is constant not just occasionally; again this is right out of the box after setup. We read about these practices on other reviews mentioning KOJAK SALES but disregarded them thinking it would not happen to us.. Deceit does not lead to repeat sales or good reviews.

No device should freeze and restart every time you try to use it. I won't even be running any programs on the phone, I'll just go to unlock it to do something and it happens.

So I agreed to get the credit to avoid the trouble of having to ship the phone wait for the return process to complete before I’m able to buy another phone.

I am wasting my time, energy, effort and money to fix a phone that should have been sent as promised with a decent battery life to begin with.

The screen and buttons only decided to work when it wanted to, ""red flag"" but I tried to make it work. However right out of the box the phone was turned on and ready to use as if someone else already set it up, ""red flag #2"" because the phone should have been factory reset. The face recognition was immediately unusable due to the camera depth sensor not working. I was hoping this phone would allow me to not have to buy something brand new that cost at least $1000 - but I was wrong to think that. After both buttons and screen not functioning properly, the phone set-up was not able to be completed and the phone itself was not processing at the same speed that a regular iphone 12 mini should function. I was very disappointed that the phone was not functional because the body of the phone itself looked almost new.

Two factor is an absolute nightmare. Tried turning it on a few weeks ago, to give it a try, and got stuck in an instant, endless verification loop between iPad and iPhone. If I didn’t have the iPad on me at all times to verify iPhone unlocks, I would be locked out of my iPhone. It was literally a consecutive, never ending loop of non-functionality. About biweekly, Apple locks account (despite 100% consistently correct password inputs). Across those three devices, I get asked randomly for AppleID at least 10 times per week; Apple's like an additional add-on to current the spam phone call landscape. I absolutely dread initiating any Apple updates, since they're constantly changing/ taking away prominent features I once enjoyed and found convenient. The updates are impossible to ignore, since they send never ending forced notifications for system updates, despite cycles not salient for security reasons. Just changing stuff to change stuff.. iOS 10: can no longer swipe-to-switch watch faces is the last straw.. and I’m refusing to do the currently available Bing Chat/Reddit workaround. Completely switching to Samsung and Android devices; this user has had enough.. I'm out of this ""only our way"" ecosystem; which hasn't made sense since the first few iPhone iterations.

My daughter spent several months saving her money for a “refurbished” phone. After a lot of research she landed on this iPhone 12 mini. It was supposed to be in excellent condition. Right out of the box, the device exhibited difficulty in charging: known good cords wouldn’t charge it. As I was getting ready to send it back, it started charging normally again. As I looked further into this, the battery health was a disappointing 85%. I would’ve expected with an “excellent” condition phone that it would’ve had a new battery. Recently, the phone wouldn’t turn on. At all. Known good chargers/cords wouldn’t work at all. We finally took it into a shop today who told us the board was toast. This is extremely disappointing after only 5 months of use. I generally have a rule about electronics and not buying them used unless I can put my hands on them first.

This version has issues with sensitivity, something about the model of the phone, and not the OS so it's basically not fixable. MY phone, not only has sensitivity issues, it has functioning issues all the way around. It doesn't ring when it should, If it's on silent, it doesn't vibrate with every call, I have it set to dark mode, yet at least once a week, half of my apps are in light and the rest are in dark, the fun features like the tapping for the flashlight doesn't work unless it's accidental, the screen blacks out in the middle of a call so I can't even hang up or enter a number for an automated call, and the list goes on and on. If I were only dealing with the sensitivity part, I'd just chalk it up to poor research on my part and move on. But I really think I got a POC phone with ALL the issues. I've only used iPhone since the switch to smart phones, for various reasons, but this experience will have me trying something new in the not too distant future. An expensive lesson in doing better research!",-1,Battery Life & Charging

iphone 12 mini,1,2024-06-04,It wasn’t horrible but not good. I purchased the iPhone 12 mini at the beginning of may. The phone was slow the screen did have some touch issues but it was workable. Not even had the phone a month and the screen went black and all it will do it pop up the apple logo and shut back off. The battery life said 94% but the phone would die within a hour and a half of me being awake. Update: I took it to my local iPhone repair store! The phone is missing pieces on the inside. The specific piece missing is a bar that cover the battery cable connect to keep it from coming unhooked. Therefore my battery had come unhooked. I’m still pretty upset seeing the fact I pay almost $300 for the “premium” which is supposed to be the best yet they leave pieces out of the inside. This was definitely my last purchase from Amazon!

Instead, I received a device that is shockingly damaged and filthy. The iPhone is covered in deep dents and scratches, and its charging and speaker ports are clogged with dirt and wax. It's utterly disgusting. Despite being advertised as unlocked, the phone is actually blocked from use on major American carriers like T-Mobile, AT&T, and Metro. This is completely unacceptable. I waited two weeks for a phone that is both unusable and in appalling condition. This is a clear indication that the phone may have been stolen.

The seller Hybrid IT has a great reputation, but they did not help me despite writing to them several times and speaking to Amazon customer care regularly (who claimed they have also contacted the seller at least twice). Lesson learnt: whether or not the phone is refurbished/renewed, it should come with at least one year's warranty.

It also came with what I assume is water damage where dots in the screen are yellow???? I was not impressed by this. Although battery life is excellent. But the main thing is it kept turning off and the sensor for when to turn the screen off during calls is broken where I can still call and hear the call but the screen wont turn on. This was all in the start of when I got it. No new problems have arise so I will deal with it but definitely not ordering again.,-1,Battery Life & Charging

iphone 12 mini,3,2023-03-09,"My only issue was the lack of communication. While I am completely satisfied with what I got, I was made anxious by the fact that there was little to no communication between me and the product stages. I was never told when it was processed, never received updates on location for the product and I paid two day shipping. While Amazon maintained the idea that it would be delivered on the 6th at 10pm, I was never told when it was even out for delivery! I was at college in the middle of class at 6:45pm when it was dropped off. I know and realize that they did complete the agreement of 2 day shipping but I ordered the phone at the end of February and they couldn’t process or ship it until the Friday BEFORE the deadline? Kinda ridiculous that I even paid two day at that point. I would ask for a refund but they fulfilled their contract with little time to spare, but it’s complete none the less. As for the phone: All in all, for a refurbished mini, I expected the battery life to be equal if not a little less than my current SE (2nd gen). I was right as it arrived with 86%. Not awful, what I’m used to. The phone works well and runs as smooth as I could have hoped. Set up between two iPhones is a breeze now and I highly recommend the direct transfer over the iCloud if you’re someone like me who has had Apple devices since 2011 (I don’t need to text my peers from high school or my ex boss…). The color purple was stunning and everything I wanted! No dings or dents in the body or on the screen. I have loved this phone since it came out as I have tiny hands and gripping this phone makes it feel like I have normal sized hands! To summarize: The phone is great, the processing and order fulfillment barely passed requirements with a lack of communication.

iphone 12 mini,3,2024-05-21,"Scratched, many parts have been replaced with aftermarket. I bought an Iphone 12 mini in ""excellent"" condition first. All scratched up and if look very decently used. Did not care much, since I just want to use it as dashcam. Battery was at 100%- meaning it was replaced. Good and bad... since I got a message that the camera was not genuine also. So phone was damaged. Camera and battery were replaced. Problem is they got replaced with non-genuine parts. While I have nothing against aftermarket parts when I have to replace them, I have an issue when someone sells something and not disclosing that. I would rather have an old non genuine battery than a new aftermarket. Also the way Apple has been working lately what's from stopping them disabling my non genuine camera. They try doing it before I believe people were outraged and they stopped and even a law- The right to repair was also introduced because of that. Either way bought another refurb phone after returning this one. That one I got it with the lowest possible condition- ""acceptable"" or something. Also, the cheapest. Honestly as far as scratches they look identical. This one battery was at 88%- so it hasn't been replaced and no messages about non genuine parts. So I guess my advice would be to go in with a lot of expectations about these and my opinion just get the cheapest possible. Chances are you will still get the same condition unit.",-1,Battery Life & Charging

Never had a better phone. But my takeaway from this experience is to order ""renewed premium"" for electronics from amazon rather than ""renewed,"" for one reason (buried in the fine print of course.) ""Renewed premium"" gives you the buyer 12 months of satisfaction guaranteed coverage, whereas ""renewed"" gives you a mere 3 months of the same. My phone had not been abused or subjected to moisture in any way shape or form, so 4 months of cellphone service for $240 feels suboptimal, when paying slightly more for a whole year of coverage would be much less so. I'm now tasked with ""repairing"" a phone i've owned for less than 4 months and now need to repair or replace at my expense.

iphone 12 pro,1,2025-01-16,"Touch screen intermittent; battery does not hold charge. Be mindful when purchasing USED products. While they go above and beyond in the marketing of the device “factory re-manufactured” and “certified pre-owned” and ETC are all fancy wording for SECOND HAND, and USED. That said, with high hopes I purchased this device in May 2024 for my birthday, everything seemed to work fine, even though I noticed that the Maximum Battery Capacity was below 90%. —- Now in late January 2025 roughly only 8 months of use and the MBC has fallen to 77%, which has shown extreme degradation in that it cannot hold a charge. In addition, I have noticed that the touch screen is intermittent-Meaning that sometimes it works, and sometimes it does not. Sometimes no have to press multiple times and extremely firm—Note that all softer is up to day on the iOS, as well as the Apps used. Also note that I have equipped this phone with a highend sturdy case, which has kept it well protected, although it has not suffered any falls or drops of any kind. Additionally, the screen is and has been protected and covered since the day I received the phone and it still intact with NO cracks or scratches —- All that said, aside from the disappointment of the battery not being at 99% when received and now not holding a charge through the day even with a mid day recharge, I am surprised that I could not get to at least a full 2 years before minor or even major hardware degradation had set in. The question then lies with the company who is selling the phones vs the Apple product itself. I can say ALL my Apple iPhone devices have held the test of time and I’ve never had to upgrade due to hardware, but due to obsoletion. SO, it is my assessment that the company selling the second hand item needs to do a better job checking the devices before resale, as well as fairly pricing it for its age and prior use.-not to mention changing the battery component if it is below 90%. The one, and only good thing I can say was the phone appeared relatively new with little evidence of use meaning just monor scratches on the metal chassis housing, although this goes completely unnoticed as the phone is covered completely with protection. The status of the companies integrity is still up for debate, if they can accommodate my request for a replacement to a newer iPhone model, for which I will pay the difference I will then say happy shopping to all customers, if not, I will say be WEARY of buying used, older model iPhone devices by smaller relatively unknown companies.",0,Phone Functionality & Defects

Now it shows an empty battery when it’s clearly charged, and when you plug it in, it magically jumps to 50%... then disconnects on its own like it has a mind of its own. This thing is possessed. Defective straight out of the box. Returning it, obviously, but if you enjoy wasting time, money, and goodwill, this is the perfect product for you. I work in IT. Trust me, this people did not even bother to check the conditions of the motherboard, which is clearly defective. Maybe you won't have any problem right away, but whatever you are buying from this seller IT'S NOT RELIABLE. And they sell it as ""excellent conditions"".

I thought by buying refurbished from AMZN, a trusted source, I would be OK. Wrong. Within a few weeks of using it the screen started acting funny. Not fully malfunctioning, just small things: a swipe here and there wouldn't work, the top of the screen would occasionally not respond to touch/swipe, a spontaneous video call when typing a Whatsapp message (embarrassing!). The small snafus gradually got bad enough that I called AMZN support and asked them what my options were. The answer: none unless you act almost immediately after purchase (when it of course was still working great). Finally, I took into the Apple store to get a replacement screen for $279 after I grew tired of constantly working around the malfunctions. To my great surprise, Apple wouldn't repair it b/c the phone had an indicator that water had been inside. Once that happens, they won't touch it if it's out of warranty (which it is when you buy refurbished). Mind you, iPhone 12 is rated “IP68,” which means it's fully protected from dust and is water resistant for up to 30 minutes at a depth of 6 meters. I never dropped my phone in the water, not once. Which means AMZN sold me a lemon and I just didn't realize it until too late. Apple will credit me only $100 for trade-in value, so $400+ is up in smoke after about a year of use. Be warned!!

My fully 100% charged phone with no use, allowed to sit for 16 hours will discharge to approximately 50%. Additionally, the ear volume is too low and can not be turned up by any means. Was placed on a call to Apple Care by Amazon, and was told that my phone is defective and needed to be returned to shop or store it was bought from. This is where the ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE from these people comes in at: After conversing with them over how to return this phone, I was given instructions that are unworkable via the Amazon website, (and was told to call Amazon, which I am glad I did in the end). After I told this vender to return my trade-in and was seeking a full refund, all communication from their side abruptly stopped. They never sent me the required paid return label and authorization number to send this defective phone back to them. This resulted in an A to Z Amazon guarantee claim against this third party vendor for their inaction. Lesson learned for me here, is deal only with Amazon proper and no third party sellers. This seller is only interested in the sale. If your purchased phone is not defective, everything is great with this seller. But if your phone is defective, just expect to fight for your refund and pray that you get your old trade-in phone back. Update: Amazon A to Z guarantee finally did give me an authorization and paid return label to send the defective phone back, and refunded me the cost of the purchased phone plus my trade-in phone that got lost.

iphone 12 pro,1,2023-01-22,"PLEASE READ THIS Before Buying - two covered up cracked screens. TLDR: this phone and a different excellent condition iPhone 12 Pro Max renewed had “screen protectors” with a thick layer of adhesive to hide extensive screen damage. On the pro max it was deep scratches and on this 12 pro a massive crack pictured above. I ordered a renewed excellent condition iPhone 12 Pro Max. When getting ready to apply a screen protector I noticed the top right corner of the screen was cracked. On closer inspection I found it was a screen protector, but when I removed it I found there was a thick adhesive type layer that fills in the gaps on numerous scratches of the actual screen so you can’t see them. At first I thought no big deal - great reviews so must be a one time weird thing and didn’t like the size of the pro max anyways, so I bought this excellent condition iPhone 12 Pro. Same thing this time, but worse. Rather than deep screen scratches, there’s a massive crack running the length of the screen underneath the screen protector. This wouldn’t be visible without removing the screen protector that comes on it but regardless, two iPhone 12’s in a row through renewed (not renewed premium) have hided the fact that these are not excellent condition in the slightest. And rather than replacing the screen, the seller has covered up the damage in the cheapest way possible. Lots of good reviews for these, so I imagine not all are as bad as mine. But, considering this happened back to back, it isn’t a coincidence and I’m sure others have been scammed by this as well.

iphone 12 pro,1,2024-09-10,BEWARE OF THIS SELLER. I bought an Iphone 12 phone from this seller 3 months ago for my daughters Birthday. Two weeks ago it started to shutdown by just setting it on the table. over a two week period the phone would take longer and longer to turn back on and now will not turn on at all. This means I was sold a defective phone. This phone has never been dropped nor has any water damage. All the seller said was it's outside of the return window to exchange or get a refund. Unfortunately did not have insurance because bought from third party and now have to buy my daughter another phone from a much better vendor. There customer service is little to now help by saying we can help with troubleshooting steps. Obviously they did not listen when I said the phone won't turn on at all so how can they provide troubleshooting steps. Be careful with this Vendor,-1,Phone Functionality & Defects

However, the real problem came when I tried to use the phone to make calls. The right microphone doesn't work, which means that nobody could hear me on phone calls (although I could hear them). This defeats the whole purpose of a phone I took it to the Apple service center who told me that fixing this problem would require the replacement of the complete Rear System which is a major repair.

I think this would have done better if from Amazon but I did not want to deal with a third party and go through the hassle of trying to get my phone back on so I could factory reset it before being sent back. There would have been no way would send my phone back and it was signed into my iCloud and someone would have access to all that information. So I lost over $500 dollars because I could not reset my phone to send back. Just beware that you might might get a defective phone or a great phone.",-1,Phone Functionality & Defects

iphone 12 pro,2,2023-09-19,"Almost too good to be true. 3 month update: Stick to Apple. Buying an Amazon-refurbished iPhone 12 Pro was a big mistake. Just 3 months later, my phone blacks out, I mean the screen turns off while I’m using it and it’s very difficult to turn the screen back on. I literally have to wait until it’s ready to do it on its own. And yes, all my updates are current. Btw, I bought one in gold and another in pacific blue and they both have similar issues. My advice, purchase direct from the Apple Store and save yourself the headache and additional expense. Initial review: Firstly, the phone arrived ahead of schedule. Outward appearance, 10/10 as there were no scratches or distinctive markings on the phone. Upon testing the phone, which I initially thought worked perfectly, I realized that there was no audio coming from the ear speaker/receiver. I reported the issue to my seller, MOBILESUPPLY, who admittingly was very quick with their responses and were willing to assist with a return or a refund. Luckily, we were able to run a complete diagnostic with Apple who in the end fixed the speaker issue, which required me leaving the phone at the store for a few hours. Overall, the product was well kept, although I strongly suggest MOBILESUPPLY retest ALL aspects of the phone's performances before selling it to customers. This could have easily cost me additional funds, or I would have to go through the hassle of returning the item as I live outside of the US and was only there for 3 days. :(",-1,Phone Functionality & Defects

iphone 12 pro,4,2023-07-16,"Nice Phone. I’ll preface this review by saying I am pretty picky when it comes to my possessions. My IPhone 7+ finally gave up the ghost. I was hoping to get through the remainder of this year so that when the IPhone 15 came out that I would get a renewed 14 Max Pro but that was not to be. We had purchased a renewed IPhone 12 for my son from another seller and were surprised with how clean it was when it arrived. We paid extra for the excellent condition and it was in pristine condition with a 100% battery max battery health. Prime day comes along and I see this phone from this seller. It was roughly $200 more than the regular IPhone 12 that we bought for my son but it was the Pro model and it did have 512k of storage. Due to the positive experience we had with the earlier purchase, I decided to pull the trigger. Fulfillment was great. I had ordered the phone on 7/11 and it was scheduled to arrive on 7/14 but to my surprise it hit my house on 7/13 which was a nice surprise. When I picked up the package I got worried because I could hear and feel something rattling in the box that was shipped in a form fitting padded envelope. To my relief I found the phone to be intact. It arrived with protective plastic on the screen, a SIM port tool, and a lightning charging cable that was loose in the box. Upon inspection I found the screen to be free of scratches or gouges but there is some slight surface marring on a small section of the screen that you have to look for in order to see. The bezel was clean except for a couple of nicks. The worst sign of usage is a chip above the top of the highest camera lens. It’s not huge but you can definitely see it and it looks like a chip in a car windshield since the back of the phone is finished in glass. The only other thing to mention is that there was a bit of what looks like green metal tape that was poking out of the side of the phone between the screen and bezel which I was able to rub off with my fingernail. It looked like the refurb process was not as clean as it could have been. Going into the settings I found that the max battery life was only 85% which was kind of a bummer. Setting up the phone was a breeze with ICloud but I haven’t figured out how to pull down the pictures that resided on my old phone. My apps came over but know I had to re-enter my passwords in most cases. After only a couple of day usage, everything seems to work fine. Amazon gives 90 days to return for any issues. The camera on the pro is a definite improvement over the 7+. Size wise the unit is smaller than the 7+ but the screen is bigger on the 12 since it doesn’t have the home button at the bottom which I keep wanting to press out of habit. Overall the purchase was better than ok. If the phone has another 10% of battery life and the nick on the camera was not present then I would rate the item as excellent. I’ll always wonder if I should have purchased a phone from the other seller that sold a phone in perfect condition. I will update this review should anything major happen with the phone.",0,Screen & Cosmetic Condition

iphone 12 pro,4,2024-09-07,"Phone came in good condition, but wasn’t fully cleaned. I got the iPhone 12 Pro with Amazon’s “renewed - premium” option. The brand was “HybridIT”. Just got the phone today, and it’s working great and as expected so far, but do I have a few concerns. My biggest concern is with the packaging. The phone was simply placed inside the cardboard insert with no foam sleeve or protection (as shown in 1st picture). You can see there’s about a 1/2 inch of wiggle room with nothing holding it in place, meaning it was very likely sliding around the cardboard during transit. Luckily I didn’t notice any major damage or scratches. Another smaller concern is that the phone was visibly not thoroughly cleaned. The smudges and marks easily came off, but you can see some grime along the side edges (refer to pictures). I was hoping for a higher standard of cleanliness with Amazon’s highest option. Otherwise, the phone does work great and feels almost brand new. I’ve tested all the features with no problems and was pleasantly surprised to see the battery health was at 94%, which is really good considering phones generally degrade to around 90-80% (depending on use) after a year or two. Keep in mind, I’m not sure if the packaging issue is a problem with Amazon renewed or HybridIT. However, all in all the phone itself is in good condition.

When I received the package the phone wasn’t packed in it’s original Apple boxing which would’ve been nice since I’m gifting this IPhone 12 Pro to my boyfriend but I’m actually pretty happy with my order. I like how the phone came with a brand new installed glass protector that looks flawless and multiple SIM card tray keys which comes in handy. It’s expected for a refurbished product to have some flaws but this phone has extremely minor and very minuscule flaws such as some very almost unnoticeable scratches around the edges of the phone unless you really look and give close up and sharp eye examination but they’re so minor and the phone is going to have a case eventually anyway. I’m not going to hold the non Apple boxing against the seller and product because again this is a refurbished product and not brand new and I’m overall very happy with the quality of what I received and I did like the kind of box it came in. Along with the phone is a charging cord and wall adapter that’s not by Apple and is by a company called Ashley.

The device worked as it should except when I tried to use the rear facing camera, I noticed the picture was very blurry. I contacted Amazon and they walked me through a series of steps to attempt to fix the issue. When that didn’t work, they contacted the seller directly and expressed my concerns. The seller said I could return the phone and if they had a replacement in stock they’d exchange the device, but if it was out of stock I’d get a refund. I asked if they could send a replacement before I sent the phone back since I didn’t have another phone to use, but the seller was adamant that they receive the device before sending a replacement. So I sent the defective phone back and waited a week before I heard anything. I was then informed that I’d be receiving a refund. If I would’ve known that I’d be getting a refund, I would’ve bought a new phone once I knew this one was defective. I appreciate that this seller stands by their product and made the situation right, but it was a great inconvenience to me as a buyer not having a phone for 7 days.

iphone 12 pro,3,2024-06-14,"Beware of what's under the hood. Here's a review for a refurbished iPhone 12 Pro with poor voice quality and a depleted battery: Title: Buyer Beware: Refurbished iPhone 12 Pro Falls Short If you're in the market for a refurbished iPhone 12 Pro, proceed with caution with the units gor sale here. My recent experience with a supposedly ""certified"" refurbished unit from a third-party seller has been nothing short of disappointing. Let's start with the voice quality. Despite being touted as ""like new,"" the voice quality during calls is abysmal. Voices sound muffled, and there's a constant static noise that makes conversations a struggle. In an age where crystal-clear audio is expected, this issue is simply unacceptable. But the problems don't stop there. The battery life on this refurbished unit is a joke. After a mere few hours of moderate use, the battery drains alarmingly fast, leaving you tethered to a power source. And to make matters worse, the battery health has already depleted to a dismal 88% – a far cry from the promised ""like new"" condition. Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of this purchase is the lack of warranty coverage. Since the Apple warranty has expired, any issues that arise will be solely the responsibility of the new owner. That means costly repairs or replacement expenses down the line, effectively negating any potential savings from buying a refurbished device. In conclusion, while the allure of a discounted refurbished iPhone 12 Pro is understandable, this particular unit fails to deliver on its promises. Poor voice quality, abysmal battery life, and the lack of warranty protection make this a purchase I cannot recommend. Unless you're willing to take a significant gamble, it's best to steer clear of this particular offering and explore alternative options.",-1,Battery Life & Charging

Why did you pick this product vs others?: I picked this 12 Pro Max because it offered me an upgrade to my iPhone XS Max without having to pay Apple $600 for a refurbished one. Yes, this 12 PM is refurbished as well, but it was almost $200 less and 2yrs newer. I chose a seller who had very high customer satisfaction ratings and paid a little more than the cheapest price shown. For that extra $$, I got a refurbished “excellent” phone that looks brand new and shows 96% battery capacity. Unless something goes wrong and it stops working, I’m happy with my purchase.

iphone 12 pro max,3,2022-12-09,"Ended up ok but started out as a nightmare. I ordered this phone to save money, but also to match the one my spouse has. First, the phone arrived in great packaging, well protected, and no outer blemishes or problems. When beginning the setup process, it continued to get stuck on choosing the country. After several restarts, it would just get stuck on country. So I did some research. I also contacted the company at this time. Ultimately I learned online that I needed to connect it to my laptop, upgrade the software, then do the setup. That time it completed setup (after several attempts). However, now the phone was in SOS mode. I didn't think much of it because I did not have the sim in at that time. This complete process took about 2 hours. After I put in the sim and started the phone, the network still said SOS. More research. Still no call from the company. About 6 hours later, 4 attempts at factory reset to start over, and chatting with my cell carrier, I gave up with the phone still in SOS mode. It was still updating all my apps though, so I let this happen throughout the night. The next morning I called my carrier again and they worked me through a few more things. Ultimately they had to do a reset on the sim because something in the phone was triggered as being hacked so it shut off the sim as well. I'm not sure how this really happens, but this is what was told to me in layman's terms. Thankfully after another hour in the morning, my carrier was able to get the SOS mode off and reset. It is now working well and continuing life as usual, with an updated phone. So, buyer beware. If you're buying a phone online to save money, make sure it has some kind of return policy. This one did, and we were originally told by our carrier that we may have to return the phone. I'm glad we pushed through the problem, because I hate doing that. However, just be prepared for some kind of issues to pop up. We would have had to pay the Apple Store or somebody else to fix it IF it didn't have a return possible. Ultimately this phone ended up being ok. The looks are fantastic; no scratches or blemishes. We are not sure on battery life yet, and I will update this review IF I see the battery life is diminished. Otherwise, besides the problems we had in the beginning, the phone has been overall good and now functioning well.",0,Phone Functionality & Defects

Condition: The exterior is in good condition. 1 minor scratch on 1 of the camera lenses, a few marks around the speakers that indicate to me that the previous owner kept a case on the phone. Battery health: Not very good for a phone in supposed ""excellent"" condition. The battery capacity is at a measly 77%. I'm actually very disappointed by that, as I would have hoped for at least 85%. In fact, with nearly a quarter of the battery capacity gone, I can't give the product any more than 3 stars. I charged the phone to 50% before work at 5:30.

The battery health was at 81% which was a bummer but it is what it is. The screen was okay at first. It worked well. Then one night it just it wouldn’t work so I had to turn off the phone and turn it back on. A day after I got the phone, I tried putting a screen protector on it. I had 4 of them. I thoroughly cleaned the screen before putting them on. Yet for each one, there were always some spot or damage shown on the screen which I think the screen protector revealed. At first I thought I didn’t clean the screen properly or put them on properly. But after the fourth one I realized the hidden damages on the screen.

iphone 12 pro max,1,2025-02-11,"Buyer of IPhone seller!. I bought this Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max through an Amazon seller, so I thought it would be legitimate and actually work. When I got the phone, I had to change it all into English, which was fine, but a red flag. When I bought the phone, it said the condition was excellent. The phone would not hold a charge throughout the day and was constantly extremely hot whether I used it for even a small amount of time or had to charge it from a low (charge) percentage. One day after about 3 months, it just completely stopped working and gave me a black screen. It would not charge. I tried to get it to work through Apple customer service and my Apple laptop. I also spent approximately 6 hours at my cell phone carrier trying to get it to charge up. Finally, I gave up and just bought a new iPhone 16 after the manager informed me we had exhausted every option at this point. I contacted Amazon for a refund and even requested an additional review after I was denied. Amazon told me that I could only return the phone up to 14 days after purchase, which is ridiculous because I would assume a phone would work after 3 months! So now I am out of $450 and I bought all 12pro max accessories that I’m out of money as well. I ended up having to buy the new iPhone 16 anyway which I should have just bought from my phone carrier in the first place. I now have a $450 phone that is unusable whatsoever.

iphone 12 pro max,1,2023-12-07,"Pass- buy refurb from Apple if possible. I have waited over a week to receive this item and I am extremely disappointed. I have purchase this directly from Apple. Issues: - the charger set is not the stardard Apple set. I would suggest not using it at all. The actual charging wire is extremely short and the box is extremely flimsy and I can guarantee you it will get hot. I’m using my standard Apple charger that comes with phones and products nowadays to charge this phone because I absolutely do not trust the charger set that it comes with. - the battery life is CRAP! My battery capacity is at 85%. I am upgrading from an iPhone XS Max which is currently sitting at 80% so it is not worth the upgrade. I charged the phone for an hour and it just keeps dying. Yes I am setting it up but it dies like my xs max. Pass - delivery: I waited around all day. And instead of delivering this pretty early, this phone sat in the truck all day in the cold. So I don’t know if it will have any effect on performance, but I’m not happy about it. - immediately after initially posting this review, I turned the phone over and looked at the camera, and I was horrified. There was so much gunk around the lenses of the camera. I was absolutely disgusted. So not only do you know for a fact that this is a pre-used phone, but furthermore Amazon did not clean the phone at all. I now purchased the same device from Apple and the battery capacity is at 100%. I paid $208 more but I think the quality the experience the delivery the phone itself is so much better and made it worth it. Pros: The phone works if you are in a pinch and you don’t want to buy directly from Apple I guess this will do. But honestly as someone who has a lot of experience with buying refurbished goods, especially when it comes to Apple, this is the worst product I have. And the price keeps fluctuating. I paid $495 and the seller was amazon.com and the shipping was Amazon as well so I bought direct. I am using the phone now to type out this review and the microphone works but overall I really would not suggest buying this product from Amazon. It will not come with the product box nor will it come with the standard Apple charger. Also, please bear in mind that they are not going to issue a refund for 30 days. This was a complete waste of time money and energy waiting for this phone when I could’ve just bought it from Apple. Learning lesson. Hope this helps someone.",0,Battery Life & Charging
iphone 12 pro max,1,2023-08-30,"This thing is garbage. Why the fuss?. I got my first Android device in 2010, and have had nothing but Android devices (Motorola, Samsung, LG, Nexus, and Pixel) since then. In 2022, I decided to switch to Apple because I respected some of their corporate governance and wanted to reward them, so I started out with this device. WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK. Touch stinks. Autocorrect stinks. Predictive text stinks. Voice stinks. Hardware problems, including battery charging problems. Didn't yet have haptic feedback when I bought it in 2022! Can't select and paste partial text from messages... Even the Apple case I bought cracked the first time I tried to take the phone out again. The first time I went to set an alarm, I couldn't use the clock.. I had to go to Sleep app, sign in, then it redirected me to another Health app, and another sign-in, just to set up the first alarm. I should have stopped there. The learning curve from Android to Apple was very easy, but the device and its function are WEAK. Keep working on your cameras and emojis, Apple. That's what Steve Jobs would want - not quality and innovation.... I have so many daily frustrations with this thing, I absolutely hate it and I will *** N E V E R *** buy another Apple product for my own use. The only way I could see this being of any value is if you have every aspect of your life integrated with Apple devices and applications... but that seems like a longshot, given this chunk of garbage.

iphone 12 pro max,1,2023-01-22,"PLEASE READ BEFORE BUYING - COVERED UP SCREEN DAMAGE. TLDR: this phone 12 pro max and a different excellent condition iPhone 12 Pro renewed had “screen protectors” with a thick layer of adhesive to hide extensive screen damage. On this pro max it was deep scratches and on the 12 pro a massive crack running the length of the screen. I ordered a renewed excellent condition iPhone 12 Pro Max. When getting ready to apply a screen protector I noticed the top right corner of the screen was cracked. On closer inspection I found it was a screen protector, but when I removed it I found there was a thick adhesive type layer that fills in the gaps on numerous scratches of the actual screen so you can’t see them. At first I thought no big deal - great reviews so must be a one time weird thing and didn’t like the size of the pro max anyways, so I bought an excellent condition iPhone 12 Pro after this phone. Same thing this time, but worse. Rather than deep screen scratches, there’s a massive crack running the length of the screen underneath the screen protector. This wouldn’t be visible without removing the screen protector that comes on it but regardless, two iPhone 12’s in a row through renewed (not renewed premium) have hided the fact that these are not excellent condition in the slightest. And rather than replacing the screen, the seller has covered up the damage in the cheapest way possible. Lots of good reviews for these, so I imagine not all are as bad as mine. But, considering this happened back to back, it isn’t a coincidence and I’m sure others have been scammed by this as well.

So yeah I get it it’s refurbished/renewed but here’s the deal if I’m paying almost retail just to give you an idea this 2 year soon to be 3 year old phone was about 15% off retail and at that I expect retail quality here are it’s issues the touch screen isn’t very responsive or sensitive to touch the battery doesn’t even last all day under normal use 12% currently and already charged twice to full in 12 hours and finally the price is extreme for this quality $750!!! Simply put you’d be much better off buying brand new than going refurbished. For one if you buy refurbished you have no clue what you’re getting I did a serial look up on this particular phone and it’s 2 years 8 months old it must’ve had a hard life either in construction or something because it has taken me about 10 minutes just to type up this review due to how unresponsive the touch screen is absolutely terrible experience. I will be buying brand new from my carrier moving forward thankfully this item is returnable because once the new phone comes in this is going right back to the seller.,-1,Battery Life & Charging

Called to see if someone could expedite the process of me getting a replacement since Id already been w/o a cell the past week. No accommodation at all!! Representatives had no way to authenticate my account since my phone was broken. I tried to explain this several times. I’ve been an Amazon prime customer for years so this whole situation was very disappointing. I thought these phones were “tested” for quality. Now after initiating refund, I have to wait a week for amazon to receive the defective device before I can even get a refund. The refund will then take up to 4 days.

I got it refurbished and it was a good solid phone but the case I got for it wasn’t good enough so eventually too many slips out of my pocket lead to its demise. When first bought it was like brand new, perfect shine and no scratches. Battery life did gradually get shorter and run out of charge over time quicker as the months passed. I had the phone for almost two years. Nice, slick feel in your hand without a case. Phone was super easy to unlock and get situated with my phone company. Everything transferred over quick and without hassle or having to go to a phone store. However after too many falls to the ground over time, the day I gave birth to my son it decided to go green and pink screen. The camera quality also got bad over time from a crack in the lense.

iphone 12 pro max,4,2024-12-10,"Better than those eBay deals!. Why you should buy on Amazon instead of eBay: better pricing, better quality, and better battery health. This battery health is 89% and my iPhone I own before buying this is at 76%. That’s one reason why I bought this iPhone. Today I also learned from experience that the reason why it has three camera lenses is because each lens is different so they are zoomed in differently. You get 1x, and 2.5x on Portrait mode. On normal photo mode, you get 0.5, 1x and 2.5x. If you are a busy mom or a professional photographer, you probably will want some kind of iPhone that has three lens. Just imagine all the different ways you could take pictures and selfies and everything from the same distance, but using a different lens to change the whole entire game! Plus, the battery life! I can’t really say much about the battery life within the first 24 hours unless something bad was happening like battery leakage or something like that but right now everything is great so I don’t think we have anything to worry about there. I loved for the fact I was able to get the accessories for this model. It’s important to always make sure that whatever phone you get for yourself allows you to get the accessories that you need including the phone case so that’s always a plus. Switching iPhones can be a little bit confusing, but I’m a young person and I’m pretty tech savvy so I was able to learn things pretty quickly so if somebody is able to adapt to technology that is similar to what this is then they probably won’t have a problem, but for somebody who doesn’t know anything about Apple, they might want to start with an iPhone that has the physical home button. This model does not have a physical home button so they might want to get a slightly different phone if they are having that problem. It’s pretty easy to set it up if you’re familiar with iCloud. There should be enough space if you’re using iCloud for all of your photos and pictures and even if you’re playing video games, you probably will have enough space on here unless you’re downloading every single song on Spotify (I don’t recommend downloading every song on Spotify because it will eat up your whole entire phone if you have 128 GB). My recommendation is if you do buy this iPhone is to get the glass to protect the screen. Preferably I recommend the one that gives you privacy, but if you don’t want that one, you can just get the clear one because at least it will protect your screen, even if you drop it in a parking lot. I have seen many people of various generations break iPhones and other cell phones and when I use the glass protection, it has protected me over the years and it’s pretty cheap like all you gotta do is change out your glass about one to two times a year compared to the price of fixing a phone screen with a professional or the other option is deal with stupid tape all over your screen so I really recommend getting the glass. It’s annoying at first dealing with the air bubbles, but it is totally worth it financially, so please consider it! Only problems I’m having is an error about the outer cameras and a loose port.",0,Battery Life & Charging

Thankfully, someone else in my house had a charger I could use, otherwise, the phone battery would have died on me before I could even look at anything. I reached out to support for that missing piece and they wanted me to start a whole return just to send me the charger. It was more of a hassle to return the phone after all the setup, than it was to just buy a new charger so I just ordered one online.

(12/26/22) The phone I ordered was an iPhone 12 Pro Max FULLY UNLOCKED in Excellent Conditions. Physically, the phone is in the conditions stated. BUT came LOCKED by AT&T with an UNPAID DEBT. I sent a request to AT&T to try to unlock it, but they rejected my request due to the unpaid debt attached to phone (through the IMEI number), making it absolutely USELESS to me. It is unbelievable how the Amazon Renewed Store sells a phone that DOES NOT comply with the standards and conditions that they declare in the product's description. They CLEARLY establish that: ""Fully unlocked and compatible with any carrier of choice (e.g. AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, Verizon, US-Cellular, Cricket, Metro, etc.)."" But this is a total LIE since I can't even use the phone right now due to it being locked. I'm awaiting for the seller's response regarding this. UPDATE: (12/28/22) I wrote to the seller on Monday 26th, and they promptly responded with an explanation (a badge of phones were still locked) and a solution (wait 24-72 hrs for the on air unlocking). Safe to say that, just as they said, 24 hrs later the phone was fully unlocked. Changed the rating from 1 star to 4 stars (not going to give 5 due to this issue, but TBH they deserved it).

Cameras work fantastic, I have no issues with glitches and the provided charging cable worked 100%!

And lastly, there are some areas that have what looks like dirt specks in small crevices, nothing too major and you can't really see it unless you're 10 inches or closer. Charging port also looks a bit dirty but it charged fine and fast with the cable provided. Final grading: 9.3/10, would buy again!

iphone 13,3,2024-04-18,"1st order = low quality replacement screen; but returned/swapped for good phone. Initially, we got a phone from this vendor that was a dud (for us). We returned it and tried them a 2nd time. The 2nd phone seems a decent deal. For the first phone (iPhone 13) we received: The battery life on the renewed phone was fairly good - at 94% of original capacity. This had been an issue with phones from this vendor per other reviews but was not an issue with ours. However, this renewed phone had a non-Apple replacement screen that was noticeably low in quality - grainy, with colors dulled, and it cut off part of the display area. Touch responsiveness was bad. Given Amazon pledge that the product was ""professionally inspected and tested by Amazon-qualified supplier,"" I feel the substandard screen should have been spotted and the lower quality disclosed. My family member and my time were wasted by this attempt to pass off a lower quality solution. Return process was easy, although it did require a trip to the UPS store. For the second, replacement (iPhone 13) phone: The replacement for the returned 1st phone arrived quickly. The battery life seems great (100% of original capacity). The screen this time is MUCH better than the low quality screen on the original phone.

Luckily my mum liked the colour of the phone and bought it off me so I didn’t have to go through the hassle of returning it, but I had to order a different phone so I’m without a phone for nearly two weeks longer than expected. Colour aside, I ordered the excellent quality and it’s appearance was as promised with no visible damage to the exterior of the phone. The battery life was at 90% and charged quickly and seems to hold its charge for a good amount of time. It’s fairly easy to use, though the touch screen wasn’t perfectly responsive (though in my experience no iPhones are).

I’m going to get the battery replaced, but otherwise every other aspect of the phone is perfect and working well! Update: In order to get the battery replaced, I had to get the display replaced as well, as it wasn't a genuine apple display. That costed around $400 at the Apple Store.

I purchased it for my wife. when she opened she didn't really notice the condition of the room but because I had previously repaired phones professionally I noticed something lookes off. When I looked at the back there was a crack on the bottom right corner of the back glass. I then started looking closer and realized the back glass and screen had been replaced with third party parts. The screen used was not OEM. You can tell the difference when you place them side with an original. There's a slight display size difference. Also the screen was slightly lifted which you can view from looking at it from the bottom of the phone. This caused it to make a light ""popping"" sound when pressed. The back glass was even worse which is why it probably cracked so easy. There was still some sort of adhesive being used but it wasn't seated fully and the metal rings around the camera which aren't part of the glass back assembly had some small barely visible scratches. This let me know it was a broken device that was repaired. Poorly at that. If the device isn't using OEM parts or the original parts that came with the original phone, they should not be labeled EXCELLENT condition. Thankfully the customer service was good so they did say they will refund me within 3 business days. All I have left to say is buyer beware.

As I am strapped for money, I decided to go the refurbished route in hopes of saving a few dollars since Apple got rid of the monthly card installments for an unlocked phone.

Unfortunately, I immediately started having issues once I connected it. It started freezing, I couldn't access my settings or voicemail, and my battery life was already at 85%. I restarted the phone and it worked for about 30 minutes before I started having issues again. While on the charger, at about 90% charged, it turned off on me a twice while I was using it. It didn't automatically turn back on so I had to turn it on again both times. I figured that wasn't a huge problem and would contact Amazon customer service in the morning if it did it again however I started having more problems. Had to make a quick trip to the store and thats when I noticed that as soon as I got in the car and was no longer connected to wifi, it immediately just went to ""No Service"". I would restart it and when it turned on, it would work for a about 3-5 minutes but then would go back to ""No Service"". Fortunately, I knew where I was if not I definitely would have been lost at night. After I got home, I restarted a couple more times but it wouldn't connect to my cellular data anymore or work t all unless I was connected to WIFI. As I stated previously, I had high hopes. Unfortunately, looks like I got a defective phone but I can't risk or deal with the chance of getting another refurbished phone with problems so I decided to go and ahead and return the phone.

That should include the software too!!!!!!! So no I think the seller doesn’t care because all of the iPhone should have been excellent. Not just the way it looks. Paid $307. Why would I pay another $89 which would make the iPhone $396. So basically $400. A new unlocked iPhone 13 128GB at Best Buy is 549.00. I’d rather buy a new one with no problems at all.

Two things: Immediately upon unboxing the phone, I noticed it was dirty. Like, gunk caked on the sides where the buttons are and on the bottom where the speaker/charger port is. It looks like someone took someone’s phone out of its case after prolonged use and just put it in the box. Secondly, as SOON as I started using the phone, I noticed that I could only hear calls via speakerphone. The other person could hear me just fine, but I couldnt hear them through the internal ear piece speaker next to the front camera. After countless google searches, trouble shooting forums, hours cleaning out my speakers with isopropyl alcohol, resetting my network features, you name it. It turns out it is NOT a software bug, and the phone itself is defective. The sound from the internal speaker is either muted completely (no audio) or its extremely distorted, crackling, sounds like terrible radio static, etc. The only thing that seems to fix it (temporarily, i have to do this several times a day) is by pressing down on the screen a few inches under the front camera. And even then I have to play a guessing game with where and how hard to push! Amazon has this product listed as ‘inspected, tested, and refurbished as necessary to be fully functional according to Amazon Renewes Standards.” No one even made sure the phone I received was CLEAN, let alone functioning properly. I could've had the same experience, taking a hand me down phone from a friend or family member, and probably wouldnt have had to pay hundreds of dollars for it.

I had the phone in my hands within 48 hours of placing the order, which surpassed all my expectations. It came with a charger (both the cable and block). The phone was dead when it arrived, so I needed to charge it first, but no big deal. The first thing I noticed was that there are some small chips and scratches around the edges of the device, most noticeable on the top, but with a case on, the damage will barely be visible. I've been using it without a case the last couple of days while waiting for the one I ordered to arrive, and even uncovered, it doesn't look that bad. Screen and cameras are in perfect condition. The phone was perfectly clean on arrival too, no dirt or dust. The max battery capacity is 85%. Since I paid for excellent quality, this was a bit disappointing to me and is the reason for me rating only 4 stars, especially after seeing other reviews of people who got batteries in the 90s, but it's still a major upgrade over what I had before (a 2020 SE with only 72% capacity).

iphone 13,4,2023-06-30,"""Good"" Condition. I bought the ""good"" condition model as a non-cracked screen was very important to me but the body being scratched was not a big deal. The product information says the phone should have been well cleaned, the screen has no scratches, and the body shows light scratches barely visible from 12 inches away. The phone was dirty with visible grime that my cursory wipe with an electronics swab easily picked up, it was clearly not cleaned. The phone body was more than a little scratched. It looks like it got swiped hard on the right facing edge on concrete. You can see the exposed aluminum from far away as the color difference is noticeable from the blue color I got. This is not a big deal to me as it's going to be in a case that would hopefully cover that. The screen has clearly been replaced. The screen also has a pressure glare in the upper section that is visible with some backgrounds. The screen being replaced is annoying as the notification for an unknown part can't be dismissed, so you always have a red notification visible when you look at the settings icon. Overall I would not gift it to others but for the price in comparison to other places was still good. It was also missing the charging block that the info said it was supposed to include along with the cable. I knew that I might not get the best when I opted for a ""good"" phone over an ""excellent"" condition one. Maybe I should have just spend the extra $44 dollars and got the excellent condition one.

iphone 13,1,2025-06-04,"Amazon Renewed program is a major disappointment. I tried to work with this Amazon Renewed program, but the time has come to give up on it. I bought several renewed iphone 13s but had to return one after another. I paid for phones in excellent condition but it is clear they are minimally inspected or, in some cases, fraudulently sold in the wrong category. Issues include: 1. Several had significant screen scratches, some attempted to hide issues behind new screen protectors 2. Replaced screens not original quality with significant lag and sensitivity problems 3. Lots that were still associated with old accounts 4. One had a defective charging port But the final straw came with one scratched phone that I decided to keep because it seemed less scratched than others. Sadly, I was very, very wrong. Just a couple of weeks after the 3 month return period the phone just died. Took it in to an Apple store and they spotted the issue in few seconds. They pointed out condensation in the camera lens that proved that the phone had been seriously and irreparably water damaged before I bought it. My untrained eye failed to recognize this issue, but clearly it should have been caught by the ""professional inspection"" that the Renewed program is supposed to provide. More likely the seller knew all about it all along and fraudulently misrepresented the phone as ""Renewed."" Attempts to contact the seller and/or Amazon to make this right have gone nowhere. Buyer beware, I worked really hard to find a winner, more than 8 or 9 attempts - all resulting in returns. All with a final, fatal result.

iphone 13,1,2025-05-27,"DO NOT BUY. We received the phone back in September, and it worked until mid-October. At that point, it would not connect to data whatsoever. The phone line was useless, and texting was useless. We went for several weeks without being able to communicate with our teenage daughter. We called T-Mobile and experienced multiple 1+ hour calls with them while they tried to figure out what was wrong. We were told twice that they would unlock the phone within 7—10 days. We waited those out. Then finally they came back with the answer that the previous account holder of the phone had stopped paying for it, and they locked the device. That’s when I went back to Synergy, the Amazon marketplace seller, and told them what happened. They quickly authorized the return and promised a refund upon receipt of the phone. I sent it back via UPS as per their instructions, and it arrived at their address in Brooklyn at 4:43p.m. on December 10, 2024. I waited a few days to allow them time to issue the refund, but it never came. So then I chatted with them again, and they said that since they didn’t issue a refund within two days, we would need to let Amazon know so that Amazon could issue the refund. I requested a call from Amazon, and a rep named Ronaldo called me to discuss the issue. Ronaldo said that it was outside the timeframe where Amazon could issue a refund and that I would need to dispute the transaction with my bank. I explained the situation to Ronaldo and that we were within the return window when this whole return/refund issue was started but that I had to allow time for the item to be sent back and for the seller to issue the refund before I could go to Amazon for help. They didn’t care and stood by their “not within the timeframe” stance. That left us without a phone and without almost $400. Stay away from this seller. STAY AWAY.",-1,Phone Functionality & Defects

As soon as I got this phone it looked fine until I realized that it had scratch marks on the camera but I thought that was it’s only problem until a few days later when I would type on the screen the top right corner on the phone felt weird and soon realized that the screen had been coming off slowly and day by day the screen had been almost off. I had to hold the screen together by using clear tape on the sides of the phone. Then on the first of June my phone started to turn off out of nowhere and then turn back on by itself. I would charge it thinking it was dead but as soon as I would put it on the charger it would turn on and then it would turn off again and it would repeat this until it stopped. I would even charge it all the way to 100% and it would go to 7% or even “die” out of nowhere when not on the charger. I immediately got tired of trying to even use this phone and it has barely been 2 months of even having it. I am severely upset at the fact that I have wasted my money for nothing.

iphone 13,1,2024-08-26,"Beware of This Company! Faulty Products and Terrible Service. I purchased a refurbished iPhone from this company in December, hoping for a good deal. Unfortunately, what I received has been nothing but a headache. By March, the phone started giving my daughter problems, and that's when the real nightmare began. I contacted the company, explaining the issues and requesting a full refund, which I was entitled to under their policy. Instead of honoring the refund, they offered to fix the phone. I reluctantly agreed, hoping they would make things right. I sent the phone back to them, providing all necessary information, including the passwords they needed to access the device. After what felt like endless back-and-forth, they returned the phone to me, claiming they couldn't access it, even though I had provided all the information they requested. To my frustration, the phone was still not working when I received it back. I couldn't continue dealing with the situation at that time because I had to leave the country. Upon returning, I decided to take the phone to a professional store to see if they could fix it. I visited two different repair shops, and neither could do anything to bring the phone back to life. At this point, it's clear that this company sold me a completely defective product and failed to fix it when given the opportunity. Not only am I out the money I spent on this phone, but I am also stuck with a completely useless iPhone. This company stole my money and neglected to resolve the issue they caused. It's shocking and disappointing that Amazon even allows such companies to sell on their platform. I trusted Amazon to vet the sellers they work with, but clearly, that trust was misplaced. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this company at all costs. They do not stand behind their products, and their customer service is a joke.

Stated it was unlocked however xfinity said they are not able to connect it to our line - says it’s common for them to say it’s unlocked but it’s actually not. I purchased on amazon because it was returnable incase something like this happened but it’s been absolutely impossible to return. Apple products apparently can only be returned by ups pickup and you have to be home when they come to get it. I have spent every day sitting at home afraid to even shower that I’ll miss them and it’s been a week of no show!!!! Amazon is useless and says you need to call UPS but they are useless too and haven’t been able to connect me to anyone who can help. They won’t let me drop it at the UPS store either. I’m so frustrated and can’t get it returned and get my $400 back!!!!! I had to buy a phone at xfinity and pay double so definitely want this $400 back! Buyer beware- don’t buy this- they lied when they said returnable - UPS will not pickup (yet my status says “picked up” UGH! They need to make this returnable to the UPS store- it makes no sense to me why I can’t ! Trying to figure out who else I can contact (besides a lawyer next ) Update: Finally the correct UPS came and picked it up after another ups driver showed up without even a label or receipt - after about two weeks of waiting for them- it’s holiday season and I know they are busy but it was very poorly organized.

I waited two days to open it because I was waiting for my screen protector and case I ordered from another place and didn't want to break it in the meantime. When we opened and put on screen protector and case, it would not charge normally. The only way it would charge was if you pulled up on the cord which is not efficient. We purposely bought a refurbished excellent one so that it would be excellent quality. It took a few days for the company to respond to our request for a refund/exchange and within that time frame, over a week will have passed before I can order a new one due to the money being tied up waiting for the refund. We sent back yesterday and hoping it doesn't take much longer. To add to the frustration, we specifically ordered this during Ohio's tax free week so we saved money on tax on this purchase, but because it was not the quality they promised, we asked to exchange it so we could save the money on the tax again. They said they couldn't exchange (even though this company had other phones on here to sell-not like I really wanted to buy from them again anyways due to honesty issues). So we, lost 30-35 dollars because we now have to pay taxes on a different product and the time wasted because my other phone went to crap in the mean time and I was expecting theirs to actually work when we received it.

It turns out that the screen itself was peeling away! Next thing I know, it began crackling and spreading. I’m now trying to return it. A refurbished product should have better quality control. I’m disappointed that the screen is falling apart like this. It has been in a new otterbox since I bought it. So it was NOT a screen protector. When I got this, I was really excited because I needed to upgrade from an old iPhone. This seems to do the trick except that it came with some sort of screen protector that I did not know was on it. As I was putting my OtterBox case onto it, one of the corners of the screen protector suddenly started peeling up and now has an air pocket underneath it at each of the corners. When I try to press the corner back down to get the air pocket out from underneath it, this weird screen protector suddenly cracked and is now spreading across this screen protector. I’m thankful it had a screen protector but the screen protector isn’t doing a good job when itself is peeling away from the screen. Now I’m gonna have to remove the screen protector and replace it with another one. That was a waste of money. The battery life is pretty good. I checked it and they guarantee it to have at least 80% of the original battery life and this came with 84% so that works. The size of the screen is pretty darn good and easier for me to see.

On taking the phone out of the box and starting it up, everything went well. Past this point, and well, it went downhill. I took my sim and placed it in the phone prior to setting it up and was met with constant ""searching for signal"". I tried multiple times to reset the phone, take out sim, even tried an esim with my carrier to no avail. After realizing my carrier was unable to assist me (and there was no support option with the seller listed), I went directly to Apple. Apple informed me the phone I had purchased had a failing cellular base band. The product details state the following ""This pre-owned product has been professionally inspected, tested and cleaned by Amazon qualified vendors. It is not certified by Apple."". I understand it may not be certified by Apple, however, if this product was ""professionally inspected, tested, and cleaned by Amazon qualified vendors"", why then did I receive a product which does not work. If Apple support identifies any other issues, I will be returning the phone and I will be expecting a full refund as the product sold does not satisfy their following statement ""The product is refurbished, fully functional, and in excellent condition. Backed by the 90-day Amazon Renewed Guarantee."" Also, as an FYI, the unlocked phone I purchased was initially set up for a carrier and was later unlocked to allow all carriers.

For months she struggled with phone calls dropping and the phone randomly restarting. We have very touchy carrier coverage in our area, so we thought it was attributed to this. After the issues got worse, we reached out to Apple and they ran a special diagnostic test resulting in issues that they said “come with a bad phone that has not been properly restored.” I reached out to the seller, and they refused to provide any type of support. I then followed up with Amazon, who sent this reply verbatim to me “The A-to-z Guarantee protects buyers when they do not receive an item or an item does not match its description. Although we understand your disappointment, you received the item and the item matched its description.” So I guess because the item matched the description of “iPhone,” they’re covered - who cares if it actually works, right???

When the phone arrived, it seemed normal at first, but once I began setting up the phone I realized the multiple flaws of the phone. First off the screen had been replaced with a lower quality one, with it being very noticeable of how low quality the screen display was. Additionally, once I tried out recording and testing out the audio, I found out that not ONE but TWO out of the three built in microphones that the phone had (bottom and front) were either bad quality or didn't work at all. The bottom microphone didn't even pick up any noise besides static, the front mic was extremely low quality, and I can tell that it's been replaced with some random part that was probably not even meant for the iphone 13. Furthermore, the display was horrendous to use, while texting you can notice the accidental double taps that the display was mis inputing.

The product was shipped and arrived quickly which was nice to see however it was shipped loosely inside of an oversized and flimsy android box with a big android logo on it. This was initially worrysome as I did not order an android phone however upon further inspection I did recieve the phone I ordered. The phone in the box does not appear to be damaged however I will not be able to test functionality until christmas comes around. My main complaint as of now is the packaging. The product I ordered is an expensive product and was shipped loose in an oversized box only to be protected by a ziploc bag it was also inside of. The big green android stamp on the flimsy box as well as the warehouse sticker on the back of the phone make a wonderful and expensive gift look haphazard and give off a ""cheap ebay warehouse"" vibe. After I purchase an empty iphone box, clean, and repackage the item and then test functionality on christmas. I will update my review. TlDR: First impressions matter a lot.

The second phone had 85% battery health, which is still good, and it works perfectly. The reason I’m giving it 3 stars is the way they dragged their feet giving me my refund. I returned it, it showed it arrived at their facility on January 12, and they kept pushing out my refund date which was aggravating because now I had two phones on my credit card bill. I contacted them on Jan 28 and they told me not to worry, I’d have my refund by February 17. I said absolutely not, they had better refund me by the end of the month, or I was going to dispute the charge. The guy chatting with me reassured me I’d get my money by February 17 and I went in circles with him on this, with us both stating the same thing over again. I ended it by telling him to tell his supervisor (who he had contacted to find out about the refund), that if I wasn’t refunded by Jan 31, I would be disputing it. I had the refund by the next day. So that was a pain and started to make me feel like it was a scam. It all turned out well, but they did not make the process easy.

There is a couple of very tiny scratches, almost imperceivable on the outside corner of the screen and one on one of the lenses (of no consequence). There is also a small ding just above the Lightning port at the bottom of the phone, also has no effect on performance. After more than 2 weeks of use, the phone has performed as I would expect and hope. The Excellent designation comes with a guarantee that the battery will have a greater than 80% health rating. Well, for this phone, it just clears that rating at 81% health. I was hoping for a higher rating, but it still qualifies by their rule and so far charging times have been normal. One more real disappointing issue for me, is that the screen, although mostly in excellent condition over its surface, the edges of it looked unusually rough, kind of wavy or uneven. This wouldn’t be so bad in use, however after installing a screen protector, this edge unevenness resulted in air pockets being created underneath the glass protector. A possible vulnerability to collecting dust and dirt. So far it has been a worthwhile purchase and I hope this phone will continue to provide excellent service.

I was a bit disappointed when I realized my box didn’t come with a SIM card pin, especially after seeing other reviews mention it. All I received was the phone and a charger. Unfortunately, the charger was subpar, it has a shortage and is not a lightning charger. Thankfully, I had an extra charger on hand, so this issue wasn’t a dealbreaker for me. One small issue I’ve noticed is that the microphone seems to be a bit low when recording voice messages, so I find myself needing to speak louder than usual.

Despite the minor dirt and the low microphone volume, it came in excellent condition. Setting up the phone was easy, especially since I was moving from Android to iPhone.

Still has lighting port but found some usb c to lighting adapters. Setup was easy switching, found most the apps are the same on any platform, just more expensive on Apple. Battery is at 86, Apple recommends replacement at 85 I believe. Sometimes the screen frame-rate drops so low it can see the refresh lines. Again no reference on if normal for Apple. About the OS, Android you can just put any music in the ringtone folder. Apple you have to buy some Zedge like ringers from iTunes or make and convert 30s audio file. Camera is not impressive, Ultra looks better and an older model. Typing is more controlled but find I have to delete everything and retype more then gboard. Like the size and weight of regular pro model better then alot of other devices. Safari is pretty good, had almost no issues, do not miss chrome. Notifications seem slow and randomly batched but Andriods a mess too. Most smart devices had no issues but Fitbit works but only in forground not really a problem. No other Android watch will work. Audio is good, thought the notch would bother me more, its definitely a camera notch. I do miss touch id, the in screen or face id is just not on the sane level.

iphone 13 pro,4,2024-06-24,"Sliver 13 pro 128gb ( “excellent” condition). I was really skeptical about purchasing this phone. After I read the reviews I decided to take a chance. I order the Silver IPhone 13 Pro in “excellent” condition 128GB. When I received the phone it came in a box with a SIM card tool, a fast charging cord, and the phone. ( there was NO block for the cord) Upon expecting the phone it was a bit dirty around the cameras however there was not dents/ scratches. For the battery life I’ve received 87% I wasn’t expecting it to be 100%,however I’ve seen others get a higher percentage. Other than that the battery being lower than expected and the camera area being dirty, the phone quality is lovely. It’s a big upgrade from my old phone.

iphone 13 pro,4,2024-03-07,"So far so good - phone came better than expected.. I was worried about buying from a third-party seller, and the ration of bad reviews. I think it depends on the seller/the randomness of the phones they fix up when you get a 'bad' one. I went through DirectCertified I believe, for a blue 128 GB iPhone 13 pro. I ordered on a Saturday, it was shipped out on Sunday, and I received it on Tuesday morning - I did have to sign for it. It came in a white box, sealed, and when you opened the box there was a 30-day warranty instruction/troubleshooting instruction. There was also a SIM card poker, a new charger underneath the phone, and the phone wrapped in bubble wrap. It also had a protective film around the phone. When I inspected it, the phone was honestly in near-perfect physical condition, just had some dirt around the camera lenses. I wiped it away quickly. The battery life was ay 87%, which is decent for a used phone, and given the price I paid, I'm happy with what I received.

I didn't like the charger they gave me. I wasn't expecting an on-brand Apple charger, but the charger it came with, charges very slow. I also wasn't impressed with the packaging. The phone was wrapped in bubble wrap, and placed in a cardboard box with the chargers and the cube rattling around in the box. Then that box was packaged in the classic Amazon plastic bag. I wish there was more cushioning for the phone. And lastly, I noticed the phone's screen is more pink than my previous phone. The picture on the left is my iPhone 13 screen, taken on the iPhone 13 Pro I bought, and the picture on the right is the 13 Pro screen, taken on my iPhone 13 camera.

The phone is in good shape, as it should since it was marked as ""Excellent"". However, the battery life was disappointing at just 85%. My own personal iPhone 13 Pro which is 2 years and 3 months old is at 89% and so I expected more from this given that it was supposed to be Excellent. Lastly, the charger that came with it is very low quality, it's a 5W charger that takes forever to charge the phone. I expected a 20W or 30W modern charger, those are not costly nowadays, the seller could have been a bit more generous. In summary, the phone is alright, but the delay in shipping and the lack or transparency is what makes this a questionable deal. The interesting thing is that despite what looked like an obvious problem with supply, which I can understand, Amazon kept selling the devices as if everything was Ok, the page kept taking orders and pretending they could get the device to you in 2 days, which was an absolute joke.

iphone 13 pro,2,2024-04-13,"Testing standards are a bit low. The refurbished version is currently priced at $679 on Apple’s official website. Batteries have been replaced with new ones and are 100% healthy. And this one costs just $479. what is the difference? First of all, it doesn't have the original packaging. It only has repackaging from Amazon. It only has a mobile phone, a charger and a charging cable, but none of them are original Apple accessories. Secondly, I think Amazon's product testing standards are a bit low, because the phone I bought had a lot of scratches and damage, and I wrapped it with a red circle, which proved that the original owner didn't like wearing phone cases and cases. The most important thing is that the battery health is too low, only 87%. It should be replaced in less than a year or two. I own an iPhone 13 pro max. As of now, the health value is still 94%. The above is for reference only, maybe the one you bought may be better than mine.

It can not even make it from 9 to 3 pm when only being used for time without the battery being on life support. While off, I also have been having issue with it draining. For instance, last night I had it charged to 80%, turned it off at 12:30 am then at 7 am woke up, turned it on, and found it at 2%. I have gone to apple for help and they have been extremely unhelpful about my issue since they found no problems and my battery health is ""good."" This phone is more trouble than it is worth.

I bought this Renewed iPhone 13 Pro listed as being in “excellent condition,” but the reality was far from that. Since day one, the GPS hasn’t worked properly—when I open Google Maps or Waze, it constantly loses signal. This makes the phone almost useless for driving or using any navigation app. Even worse, I found out that all of the phone’s components had been replaced—the screen, battery, camera, and housing. None of this was disclosed in the product description. What I received was essentially a fully rebuilt device, not a used one in ""like new"" condition. I tried to request a refund, but the seller refused to help unless I returned the product first. At the time, returning it was completely out of the question for personal/logistical reasons, and I felt abandoned with no real support. I thought I was saving money by buying a high-quality used phone, but I ended up with a defective device, no proper assistance, and now I have to buy another one. I’m genuinely afraid of going through the same thing again, especially with a seller who wasn’t honest or helpful. Very bad experience. I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone who needs a fully functional iPhone. I feel scammed and disappointed. 👎👎👎👎👎",-1,Phone Functionality & Defects
iphone 13 pro,1,2024-09-04,"Camera came damaged, low battery health, overall very disappointed. I bought an excellent condition iPhone 13 Pro. I was very excited to get the product as it's directly from Amazon with a guaranteed good quality and functioning phone. Upon opening I transferred all of the data from my old phone and my e sim, to find out that the camera was broken and the battery health was poor. The camera had these weird black blotches on the pictures, something that I've had on my previous iPhone when the entire lenses were broken, as well as a pop that read ""Not a genuine iPhone camera"", meaning that it was either a replace part, broken part, incorrectly installed, or not genuine apple product. On top of that the phone was very hot and the battery health was sitting at 82%, which is below average for an ""excellent"" quality phone. I knew this was a risk going into buying a refurbished phone, but since this is directly through Amazon I thought there would some class, reputation, and good quality control on their products. Although there is a 90 day guarantee, you can only do UPS pickup, in which a ups driver will come at a random time during the next 3 consecutive business days to pick up the package. You cannot drop off the package. How am I supposed to plan my day around a UPS driver coming at any time during the day when I have school, a job, and other things to do? I cannot just sit around my house the entire day waiting for this driver... Overall a terrible experience and I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, especially considering how bad the customer service has been with Amazon and UPS. Considering the reputation of both of these companies I decided to take a chance, but it did not pay off. Do not be fooled by the rest of these good reviews that have good quality phones unless you are a gambler.",-1,Battery Life & Charging

Not only did it stop recognizing the SIM card — making it totally useless as a phone — but even worse, the battery became swollen and nearly exploded in my hands. I’ve attached a photo showing how dangerously bloated it got. This is a serious safety hazard, and I’m honestly shocked that something this defective is being sold on Amazon. I’ve treated this device with care, never dropped it, and always used the original charger. There’s no excuse for such a critical failure in such a short amount of time. I’m extremely disappointed and feel cheated. For the amount of money I paid, I expected a safe and functional phone, not a potential fire hazard. Amazon or the seller needs to take responsibility for this. I want to know how to get a full refund, because I absolutely do not trust this product or brand anymore.

iphone 13 pro,1,2024-01-10,"Disappointing. I ‘m extremely disappointed with the phones I received from Blue Chip. I bought 2 refurbished iPhone 13 Pros That were described to be in “excellent condition”. Neither device had any noticeable flaws, but I experienced several issues as time went on. The charging cable that was provided not only could not hold a charge, but it overheated and partially melted when it was plugged into my portable battery, a battery that I’ve used successfully with several other cables. This was concerning, as the cable is one of the easiest things to get right. It makes me wonder what other corners the company cut during the refurbishing process. Secondly, I received a notification that stated that the phone was unable to determine if the camera was a genuine Apple part. It took pictures just fine, but I was not expecting to see this pop up. The second device worked fine for a number of hours, but the phone could not sustain a wi-fi connection. The wi-fi settings indicated that I was connected to my wi-fi (wherein I was logged into my network), but there was no connection icon on the top right of the screen, nor was I able to use the connection at all. Every other device in my home remains connected to the internet, it’s just the new phone that won’t. I made numerous attempts to troubleshoot the problem myself, including updating to the latest OS, resetting the network settings, hard resetting the phone, enabling/disabling airplane mode, turning off the private wi-fi address, forgetting the network, disabling the VPN, and configuring the DNS. None of these solutions worked, and the phone continues to not connect to the wi-fi. Blue Chip’s customer service is never available. Overall, this was an extremely frustrating experience and I wasted over $1,000. I will not be purchasing again.",-1,Phone Functionality & Defects

While the ""refurbished"" phone was fine at first, as it let us do the transfer, the battery was dying immediately. We charged it for hours. It died twenty minutes later. Then, the screen went on and off for a day or so. It would not fully turn on, just show the Apple logo. We then took it to a certified iPhone tech who said the battery was swelled and screen was from a back market. He couldn't fix it and couldn't perform a factory reset, so he suggested we return it. We did and paid $15 shipping to have it sent back. Days later, we received a refund of 1 cent for a $500 phone. I called customer service, who informed me that they had messaged me to inform me that, until they get my login Apple info, they wouldn't refund me. Then, they claimed I needed to log out on my Apple account. I did. Then, they claimed they didn't receive the information for that and are making me wait. Customer service claims, if it's a third-party seller, they need to issue a refund regardless. If the item is sent back within the return window, it is obvious the item is defective and the money needs to be refunded. Do not buy from them. They've done this to so many people, not just me.

Apple said it was irreparable without basically a whole new phone. The camera system is inseparably connected to the security hardware. So I started a return and ordered another one. Next day, next iPhone. Alas, it too is not as described. It reports “Unknown camera hardware.” That may result in software failure or sub-standard performance. Called support, can’t be fixed. I should not have to buy three phones just to get one that works when Amazon in their listing represents it as tested, fully functional, and up to Amazon standards. That is false advertising. I could get a lawyer. I’ve spent hours now troubleshooting two phones. What are the odds this would happen two days apart? That tells me your odds will be high for getting a garbage phone. Wasted time. Frustration. The whole point of refurbished is to save a little money. That value proposition is quickly erased when you have to troubleshoot, return, troubleshoot, return, over and over. Forget it. I will only buy refurbished iPhones from Apple. Buyer beware on Amazon. They did take both phones back but what a fiasco. Update: I would remove a star and leave zero or negative stars. In the attached photo you can see the effect of the off-brand camera parts: no zoom modes (I have 3 13 pros so I know what it should be). As a result they sold a Pro that isn’t really a pro.

The kicker for me was that when I turned it on and charged it, it got hot. vey hot and quickly. All of these things combined, hot battery, scratched phone and camera, and dirty speakers and charging port, I returned.

Initially, the raised display didn't bother me too much, even though I noticed the lack of True Tone. I figured it wasn't a big deal and planned to have it checked out by a local Apple technician here in Jamaica. However, yesterday, when I tried to take a picture, I discovered that my back camera wouldn't zoom to 0.5x or 3x and few of the camera features like the cinematic and up-close camera doesn't work anymore . That's when I realized there was a more serious problem with the phone. I understand repairs are complex and you're running a business, but I bought this phone while traveling and am now back home where returning it is impossible. The shipping cost, time without my phone (which I use heavily for work), and the customs, duty, GCT, and shipping fees to get it back into the country make it impractical, even if you fixed or replaced it. I bought it abroad to avoid these issues. I'm asking for your consideration and help with a refund, partial refund, or some compensation.

There is definitely something wrong with the battery and I find it very difficult to believe that these devices are actually getting the inspection they say they are.

iphone 13 mini,3,2023-06-06,"Return process is the worst! Second purchase better: twice updated review. I am keeping the below experience as it was originally written so you can see my first experience. I have since given them a second chance and purchased a second phone. It came on time and worked as expected. The battery life isn't perfect. But it is FAR better than my previous phone. It doesn't work like new but close enough. I'm giving them 3 stars because I originally gave 1 and the second phone is fine and I'm splitting the difference. My original review was as follows: I knew it was a risk trying a “renewed” phone. But the return stories made it worth the risk. I don’t know what these people did but I’ve lived off Amazon for years and this has been the worst. The phone wouldn’t turn on (we live and breathe off technology. We know how to manage a phone). It took over an hour on the phone (my working phone) with support to be ALLOWED to return it. Then it was FOUR days before UPS picked it up and over a week before it reached the amazon warehouse where amazon neglected to acknowledge its arrival. When I did contact them to ask what was up because it’s a lot of money and both the return message and the support person said I would receive my refund once they received the phone. Amazon told me they were going to HOLD MY MONEY FOR A MONTH! Because “it was a lot of money”. No joke! What in the world?! My current phone is dying. What am I supposed to do?! Worst purchase/return ever! Update: The refund came through sooner than 30 days. I can’t say if it had to do with customer service or in response to my repeated phone calls or my review. Hard to tell. Although, once the refund was issued, they said the funds would not be available for up to 7 days because, again, it’s “a lot of money.” I’ve decided to give them another chance.

iphone 13 mini,3,2022-12-21,"Great physical condition, but issues with IMEI and carrier. The phone arrived nicely packed, with a USB cable, wall adapter, and SIM card tool. The phone itself was in perfect condition with no obvious signs that it was a used phone. It did take a surprisingly long time to reach me- about 12 days from when I ordered it. I had trouble when it came to connecting with my carrier (a prepaid T-Mobile MVNO), however. The SIM would activate, but would show as ""Not connected"" and ""Phone not allowed"" in the settings. I spent a week going back and forth with my carrier's customer service and they basically just threw up their hands and insisted the device must be carrier locked, despite it showing as unlocked in the settings, despite it coming up as unlocked/not-blacklisted in online IMEI checkers, despite it being able to connect to both Verizon and AT&T MVNO trial eSIMs. My suspicion is that the IMEI is on some internal blacklist for either my MVNO or T-Mobile in general, but I couldn't get any customer service rep to actually escalate this to someone who could check. I would have kept this phone and switched to another carrier, but my prepaid plan had just been renewed a little over a month ago and I had ~11 months of service that I wouldn't be able to get refunded if I switched. I had been without cell service for the week I was working with them and being without cell service for an additional 12 days while waiting for a replacement from Amazon Renewed wasn't really a viable option for me. So, I ended up ordering a brand new phone from Apple directly. It cost more than a renewed phone, but not as much as I'd lose by switching carriers. Bottom line- there was probably an issue with the renewed phone's IMEI from whatever it's previous life was. It wouldn't have been an issue with any other network, and by all rights my carrier SHOULD have been able to identify and fix the issue. Thankfully, the return policy allowed me to return this phone.",-1,Phone Functionality & Defects

iphone 13 mini,3,2023-10-06,"Not a great deal, battery at 85% when received. At this price, it is not a good deal at all, unless you want a phone that Apple does not sell at all. If you can find your preferred phone at the Apple store, or in Apple Refurbished store, Apple puts a brand new battery with a 100% health, new outer shell, and sells with the original cable and USB adapter, and at about the same price as the Amazon renewed store. And you can buy AppleCare+! I am referring to a device I purchased directly from Amazon.com and not from any third-party seller. Amazon Renewed sells devices with battery not at 100%, as they state in the description. The USB adapter is not apple, and not so sure about the lightning cable. The outer shell/glass/screen is not new - they were just what they were when Amazon Renewed acquired those. In summary, you are better off purchasing from the Apple Refurb store, and if not get a new model phone. iPhone 13 mini being discontinued (Apple is supremely stupid and highly inconsiderate to discontinue a device that has a loyal following and the only one of its kind), used ones are the only way to go.

There’s two concerns: one the screen has few superficial scratches that are visible from about 12 inches.

Second, the screen has a slight visible lift (as in not sitting completely flush with the chassis) on the bottom left side; although not enough to impair operability, but prominent enough to make me question the grading criteria/ QC standard. As for the battery, it checks out at 94%. It would’ve been perfect but for the minor screen issues - the rest of the body looks brand spanking new.

When the brightness is set to ""automatic,"" in a room with stable light, the screen brightness changes. It gets dark, then back to dim, repeatedly, because the aftermarket screen's light sensor is 💩. Apple's own diagnostic program confirms my light sensor diagnosis. I can only use 1 finger to ""swype"" because whenever I type with 2 fingers, the shoddy aftermarket screen makes the keyboard double, triple, and quadruple-type letters. Apple's settings to prevent double-type are useless against this hardware.

I received the phone in the mail yesterday. I was very excited for this new phone, but upon unpacking the product concerns were already starting to come up for me. The Amazon packaging was normal, but the box inside was flimsy and the phone was very loosely packaged. There was about 4 inches of room for the phone to freely bang around in while traveling all the way to my address. Then I noticed that the seller of the phone was not who I had expected. I had thought Woot was the seller- in reality Woot was the storefront but there was no transparency as to the source of the actual phone itself. The seller was Kiss Electronics, which I found by reading the brochure in the package. Some research revealed that this seller is largely mistrusted and has a bad reputation. Most importantly, the condition of the phone was not refurbished- the refurbished claim was a huge lie. The camera lens has a deep crack and the speaker is blown with a hole in one of them. Upon further inspection it looks like someone took the SIM removal tool and poked a hole into one of the bottom speakers. The phone sounds pretty bad, so I think the damage is internal as well. The battery health is at 84% which was expected, but today when I took it off the charger and let it sit idly with the screen turned off, the battery percentage dropped by 15% in the span of an hour. I can't trust this phone, and I don't trust refurbished smartphones from Amazon because of this experience.

Beyond that is the review of the phone itself. Well, that might be a little pointless because everyone already knows if they like iPhone or not. This is my first one and I am really disappointed.

Little things like, say, putting the LONG settings menu in alphabetical order are impossible.

They already charge SO much money for these, but want to make money off every inch of your private usage as well. One of the biggest downsides is no little blinking light to tell you when you have a text waiting. Such a nice feature on Samsung. Has its upsides though. It is indeed tiny enough to easily fit into a jeans pocket. After 3 months usage the battery life is still really impressive. I mean I charge the thing like twice a week. The fast charge function is at least twice as fast as regular charging (of course you have to separately buy a more expensive charger).

The aluminum has multiple places where there are dents and scratches. The back glass has etching that may have been from a previous case. The description for “excellent” says it would be free of these things. In addition, while the battery life does meet criteria of >80%, it barely passes that mark at 82.

So I called Amazon and they didn’t help at all, they contacted the company and they took two days to respond. Supposedly the battery was replaced which means the phone has lost its waterproofing, and the scratch is supposedly normal for the company. So I asked for a replacement because if I returned and bought again it was 100$ more expensive. Well they couldn’t do that for whatever stupid reason. So I’m stuck with this phone.

A screen protector is a must. The Renewed Premium phone arrived in excellent condition and has given me no issues in six months of use. I recommend it. In detail: ---Preamble--- I didn't buy a cell phone until mid-2008, and didn't buy a smartphone until early-2019. Both decisions were provoked by starting a new job. I've never been a heavy phone user; I receive less than twenty-five texts from actual humans a year, and maybe a phone call every other month. I only use my smartphone for calls, texts, checking email/calendar, navigation, alarm, and on occasion, checking into events or to take pictures. My app usage is limited to train tickets. As a result, I don't need much from my phone. I like having something fairly powerful, so it will run smoothly for as long as possible before I have to replace it. I didn't want anything too expensive, which is why I ignored Sony's offerings. I wanted a decent support cycle, which is why I ignored the Zenfones. I wanted something with reliable HW, which is why I didn't go with a Pixel. I wanted it to have WiFi calling/texting. I specifically wanted something small and compact, as my main complaint about my prior smartphone was how large it was. I would have replaced it earlier, but it was an Android and since the demise of the Sony Xperia Compact line there were no US-market small Android smartphones produced by anyone. I didn't want to make the transition to the Apple ecosystem, since this would be my one and only Apple device, so I dragged my feet even for a year after my old phone stopped voluntarily connecting to the cell network. Eventually I decided that I spend more time carrying my phone around than using it, and therefore form factor was more important than OS. ---Review--- I would never have purchased this at its original retail price, but it was definitely worth it at $450, particularly with the Amazon Renewed Premium Program. It arrived in a condition indistinguishable from new, at least to my eye. Setup was easy enough, though despite assertions otherwise the automated process of moving Android data to the Apple was not perfectly smooth and I had to make a number of adjustments after the fact. As a result of making this transition, I still run my Google apps on the iPhone - Authenticator, Calendar, Mail, and Maps in particular. I don't plan on changing those any time soon, but it does introduce some confusion into the workflow on the phone. For current Android users, there are some significant downsides. The loss of the ability to customize the environment is painful, even after six months. I am fairly technically capable and so appreciate the ability to make minor tweaks and adjustments to everything, and iOS constantly fights you on this. I would like my small icons back, and my ability to arrange them as I see fit. The lack of robust gesture/tap support, and limited gadget/widget customizability means you need to spend more time navigating than before. iOS's reputation for a janky file system presentation is well deserved, it can be hard to tell where files are going or have gone. In a non-Apple environment, HEIC complicates file storage and backup, though there are workarounds. The messaging app, for who knows what reason, doesn't have an archive option and just lists every conversation you've ever had in one long list on the main page, and requires an extra tap after the swipe to delete anything. There's no easy way to skip or snooze all alarms. All things I can put up with, though for the first month I was rather stroppy. I adapted to the UI quickly, but again I only use very few functions on the phone in my day-to-day life. I was able - with some frustration - to pair a set of Samsung Galaxy Buds, though you can only configure them through an Android device. Build quality seems excellent; however, do not take this phone out of its package unless you have a screen protector waiting for it. I was uncommonly gentle with this thing for the four days I was waiting for the protector to arrive, storing it in a pocket which had a clean cotton handkerchief padding the screen, and I -still- ended up with a significant enough scratch that it is still visible under the screen protector in direct sunlight. Don't risk it. HW and SW performance in contrast is flawless. I agree with the common sentiment that the iOS experience is very smooth, though I may be biased on account of my previous phone being on its way out at the time of transition. Battery life for me is probably two days and well into the third. That sounds good, perhaps, but my screen-on time is very low - I'm guessing between zero and ten minutes a day, with most of it on the low end, the only exception being during navigation. It is not unusual for multiple days to pass where my only interaction with my phone is to turn off the alarm. I would expect longer battery life under such circumstances, but I suppose that so long as it lasts all day it doesn't really matter. Lastly, I would say the sacrifice for the form factor was definitely worth it. I keep my phone in a cargo pocket and it is much lighter and less bulky now, especially when crouching down. 100% worth prioritizing that feature. ---Conclusion--- Like I said above, if you are like me - you are someone who doesn't need a lot of screen real-estate, power, or extensive battery life, but still wants to have the full functionality of a smartphone for irregular use, this is probably the best choice on the market. It was worth the transition from Android and the ongoing annoyance of Apple's eccentricities of design. I would recommend it, and will consider getting the next iPhone Mini, if Apple ever releases one.",0,Battery Life & Charging

After transferring all of my information to use this phone, I learned that it consistently overheats very quickly while charging in normal environmental conditions. The battery charges slowly but it dies seemingly fast. I’ve only had the phone in use for two days, so this is what I’ve noticed so far. The phone itself looks to be in great physical condition, no dents, chips or scratches observed. After having a using the phone for several weeks, I have noticed that although the phone does heat quickly, the battery life has improved considerably.

iphone 13 mini,4,2025-04-17,"Good buy - just pay attention to the condition before purchasing since stock changes all the time.. Frist Review - has been edited after a few weeks Bought from Techlobby under the condition Renewed - Excellent (Like New) Unlocked. As far as I can tell, I got exactly what I ordered so I'd say it's worth the price I paid (under 500). Especially considering what new phones are going for now a days. It shipped quickly and arrived with it's own screen protector already applied (I have not removed it to check). Barely any scratches and no cracks. All the scratches are on the screen protector. For the body, the only wear I can see is around the camera (not on the lenses) where the ""frosted"" finish is, but that's not a problem for me. Both cameras work and it arrived unlocked and with the storage I wanted. Color looks great too. Battery looked good. I'm confident I can make 91% battery health work--I'm not a heavy phone user. I bought this with the intention to replace my current 13 mini when it eventually dies from being used for more than 4 years since I have a feeling Apple will never release a small phone again :( The one thing I'm not super happy about (not a deal breaker) is the iphone has iOS 18 -- yucky, but I'll just have to learn it (I've used iOS 15 for years). EDIT: Minus 1 star: still 4 stars--If I could make it 4.5 stars, I would So I finally removed the screen protector and found several scratches on the glass of the original phone screen. They are only really noticeable when the phone is off and in just the right angle of light. Some of them can be felt if you run your nail directly over them. None of them are so large/deep that they hamper the performance or display in a big way (at least for me) but I would personally categorize this level of wear and tear as ""good"" not ""excellent"" / ""like new.""

Battery 95% some scratches around camera ring and a lil bit around metal band , not enough to cry about , especially after putting case on I really don’t see any imperfections, honestly a brand new phone besides a few the minor scuffs , good sim, good screen, good battery ,first time I ordered a13 instead of 13 mini on accident, seller let me return quickly no fuss . I have big hands and mini is the best size hands down and I’m coming from the pro max and I love the smallness , I thought technology was supposed to get better and smaller. So much better for my EDC , also saves me from doom scrolling , I’ll leave that for the iPad. Honestly wanted to give it a 5 star but the very minor inconspicuous scratches I have to drop it one .

iphone 13 mini,4,2025-04-24,"Overral 4/5 🌟. Finally here’s my review, I have used the phone for 2 weeks now and these are my takes: It arrived incredibly fast, I ordered it on friday and it arrived Tuesday. Also the packaging was okay. With the phone itself everything worked, it came with a battery health of 86%, it works internationally with any carrier and it didn’t arrive with any scratch. Coming from a Samsung user the battery life itself it’s not as good as the phone that I had, however, it still lasts the whole day and I only need to charge it once. It arrived with a charging cable and block, but the block was damaged so I had to use a different one. It’s lightning and has a dual SIM. About the usage of the phone, everything works perfectly fine, the camera I’m amazed, the screen looks so good, the sound is just perfect and for any videos or audios the microphone has great functionality. I haven’t noticed any overheating. Something that I found interesting is the size of the phone, it really fits anywhere so the portability of it it’s a great plus. My friends and family have iPhones and you can really feel the difference and compatibility between an Apple ecosystem against an Android one. Overall I’m very pleased with my purchase, maybe what was more upsetting is the charging block being damaged but for everything else I’m having a great experience. Also the price and product are amazing, it’s almost like I bought something completely new with a nice deal. I’m really happy with it, definitely if someone asks me, I will definitely advise to buy refurbished!",-1,Battery Life & Charging

iphone 13 mini,4,2024-09-24,"Not a domestic IPhone.. I bought a 13 mini in Refurbished - Excellent condition. When I received it I wasn’t all that impressed with the packaging. Simple cardboard box and surprisingly, not much protective material for the phone itself. It was simply put into a plastic sleeve and thrown in the box. It did come with a charging cube and cable. Anyways, the phone itself was in pretty good condition. Perfect screen. The back of the phone was also pretty perfect minus a few scratches. The perimeter of the phone however had some damage but again, nothing awful. My issue begins when I try to switch my SIM card from my old phone to this new phone. Turns out the phone I got was originally bought in China which wouldn’t be a big deal but my phone carrier is having connectivity issues. It’s completely fine on WiFi but I’m not always connected to WiFi. Either way I decided to test it out and I am indeed having connectivity issues. So, unfortunately, I will be returning this phone for that reason. I bought from the seller Woot and have decided to try buying a phone from them again once my refund is processed so I will update once I receive the newly ordered phone. — update — So I opted to instead buy from Amazon directly. I didn’t want to risk getting another foreign phone and I went with the right option. Came in great condition. There is a small scratch on the screen itself (even though I bought in “excellent” condition, but it’s seriously not even noticeable unless im actively looking for it). Battery health is at 89% which is great. The back of the phone is perfect. Was a bit dirty when I first got it but nothing a little alcohol and qtips won’t help. So far it’s working great, no issues at all. The switch from my old phone was super easy. It came in a sort of vacuum sealed plastic instead of just thrown in the box. It did only come with a charging cable though, no block. If that matters.

The first one, an 8 I got in 2019, lasted until now, almost 6 years. It's still fine except for the battery. I thought about just getting a new battery for it but I figured I would have to upgrade before long because of the OS or something anyway. I got another 12 from this seller exactly a year ago but the battery in it was bad enough that I just returned it and used my original 8 for another year on the same battery. Anyway, it seems like they're a great deal, even if I need to replace the battery sooner. My first one worked just fine and I hope this one will be too.

iphone 13 mini,4,2024-09-13,"Minor scratches on screen but battery in good shape. Unfortunately I waited too long to buy a iPhone mini new from the store so I had to settle for used. I would entirely prefer a pixel or Google phone over Apple but seeing as how they haven't made a phone smaller in the past 15 years I just can't bring myself to do it. My disdain for large phones outweighs my disdain for Apple as a company so I'm very thankful they've made a miniature phone and I wanted one for quite some time. I've heard good things about this refurbishing company so I decided to give them a shot. I was pretty nervous about the battery health thinking it might be in the low 80s or 70s and I'd have to return it to get a new one if that were the case but after receiving it today the battery health is over 90! The back of the phone is nearly blemish free save a minor chip on the edge. The metal rim of the phone is nearly blemish free save a minor knick on the top left corner. (Photo included) The cameras glass is looks great but the aluminum rings around them definitely have several blemishes and scratches although this is aesthetically hardly noticeable and functionally irrelevant. (Photos included) Unfortunately the screen does have several small scratches on the left and right sides in the middle and top. While the scratches on the screen are nearly unnoticeable when the phone is on they are worrisome as I am very meticulous with using screen protectors and keeping my screen clean. I will attempt to put a screen protector on it to see if they go away, if they do not or are still noticable with one on I may return it for a different one, although I do run the risk of getting one with a lower battery health because 91% is pretty good!

The back doesn't look like new either, especially around the camera, and the seam connecting the front and back is unevenly glued.

The small box it came in was also not great... the box was ajar and the phone itself was half out of a plastic bag it came in!

But when I turned it on I saw a symbol of a closed lock with a Chinese phrase beneath it. I was able to successfully transfer my old phone data to the new phone. The new phone worked fine had my carrier, but I could not get rid of the lock symbol or phrase. I called apple support and after 3 tries was able to get rid of the problem by selecting a new pair of wallpapers. It took quite a bit of effort researching the problem along with multiple calls trying to find someone to help me with this problem. The apple support person said he had worked there 3 years and had not seen this situation before.

iphone 13 mini,4,2022-10-04,"Basically brand new, can't tell it's refurbished... BUT something you have to watch for. I can't believe this is a used phone! It's scratch and dent free, everything works as it's supposed to, and even the battery health is in a perfect 100% condition!! However, there are couple minor things I gotta point out: 1) The price difference between a brand new 13 mini (from official Apple store) vs. this refurbished unit is only about $50-$60. For a phone at this price point, I don't think many would care to pay a little bit more for a brand new one. I was lucky to get such a nice clean unit with a perfect battery, but if I have received one with a not so good battery (<90% health), I would definitely return it and get a new phone instead to save the hassle later, as my experience told me a less than 90% battery is pretty much half-dead already and frequent charging is required, guaranteed. Replacing the battery itself will cost you more than $60 for sure, at least before mass-produced aftermarket ones come out. 2) The shipment was packed without any hefty insulation. It was shipped with a small USPS priority box and the phone was in the box without much insulation protection. If I shake the box the phone would freely rock up and down, and I could tell a careless drop or if the postal worker toss around this package the phone would be damaged in no time. Fortunately mine was doing just fine after traveling from IL to TX. Hoped they could at least wrap the phone with a few more layers of bubble wrap of some sort to protect the merchandise.",-1,Battery Life & Charging

That phone had been a workhorse, had essentially functioned perfectly for years, and had been the phone I was planning to keep as long as possible rather than having to adopt the giant glorified IPads Apple markets as phones nowadays. So this seemed like a good solution— after all, you can’t buy a new iPhone 13 mini anymore. But I’m here to tell you, Amazon shoppers, I’ve had this phone less than a week, and it’s a disappointing purchase. First off the display is smaller, and there’s a black band all the way around the screen’s usable real estate— something google tells me is the result of a non-Apple display being installed. It is annoying because the old 13 mini used every millimeter of the display to make it seem like my screen wasn’t discernably smaller than the behemoth super sized iPhones. But this one— with the black border— absolutely feels significantly smaller. The screen is also noticeably less responsive and freezes up frequently. Couple all of this display BS with worse battery life than I had with my three year old 13 mini (which had never had its battery replaced), and it becomes clear that the seller is taking these discarded phones, outfitting them with substandard non-OEM aftermarket components, and selling them for way more than they ought to be worth.

Scratch on phone screen as seen in picture isn’t terrible but is also still noticeable at arms length (another untrue statement in the description).

The charger and cable are complete junk, I didn’t even bother removing it from the package. On to my issues with this phone. As I mentioned, the screen has been replaced. It is not an Apple screen. This is obvious by appearance and function. The screen is not completely flat, the edges are particularly poor. So poor, that a glass screen saver will not sit flat and adhere. If I can attach photos later, I will, it’s very noticeable even in a photo. The touch is not as responsive as OEM. The pressure sensitivity doesn’t function well either, especially the sides when trying to press on a scroll bar to quickly scroll down a page. On to the most disappointing part. The battery. It arrived with 90% battery health. I was hoping for more, but this is within specs of what the description was, so I don’t hold this against anyone. However, it’s obvious that the battery has also been replaced because the performance is dismal. It discharges at an odd rate has poor battery life and charges sooooo painfully slow! I have turned off all efficiency charging options and tried multiple tests. I have let it sit on a strong cable charger for an hour, just to have it go from 6% to 10%.

iphone 13 mini,1,2024-07-01,"Bought 2 Phones back to back from Hybrid IT - both with issues. Bought 1st iPhone 13 mini from Hybrid IT - It was supposed to be excellent apparently. But the screen edges looked off but clean, other wise ""looked good"" , but the Battery was at 78% max capacity and stated it needed service. I put 2 screen protectors from the same brand I normally used on my previous phones , and the protector would not seat, just had lines of bubbles around the sides like edge of an out of shape screen or something. So I returned and bought a 2nd iPhone 13 mini again from Hybrid IT, this one in acceptable condition, (to see maybe I'd get a phone that didn't have the screen replaced and would at least accept a screen protector). The same issues! The battery health says Service, 79% max capacity and the screen protector will not seat properly. Hybrid IT says they will refund the cost of me going to Best Buy or the apple store to get the screen replaced myself, after I go pay for it myself and send them the receipt. I think the thing is somehow their company has received 99% positive, yet both of the purchases have issues.

There were visible signs of wear on the body, the black paint near around the corners had chipped off, and there were some weird greasy imprints on the power and volume buttons that I tried to clean but did not get off. The phone looked dusty and the front speaker grill was buried under a ton of ear wax, gunk, and Heaven knows what else! From the inside, it was even worse. The battery health was at a shocking 79%, which was comical considering the whole selling point of the ""Premium"" condition iPhones is their 90%+ battery health. Not to forget, the charging port was also defective, as I had to position the device in a weird way to get charged properly.

The other is something that I found while watching a video that went to black, and that’s a bit of noticeable burn in.

I am certain, as all cracks do, this will spread and run down further into the screen. It's crazy to me that the description of the item is ""new."" Obviously, it is refurbished and therefore not new. It can't even be considered ""like new"" with three (albeit small) cracks on the screen.

I also reached out to Apple, but they confirmed there’s nothing they can do either. I reached out to the seller, completely unhelpful (tried multiple times, finally someone answered and instructed to send a message through Amazon), and the response was: “Due to the age of the order, we cannot help.” I even tried to file a formal complaint, but that option wasn’t available. asked customer service to file a complaint, they said they cannot!

The screen was clearly not original—it was warped, cheap-looking, uneven surface and not properly fitted. Within 6 months, the screen completely died, now just showing lines and strips. This seller clearly uses low-quality, third-party parts and passes it off as “renewed.” That’s not just misleading—it’s dishonest. For the price I paid, I expected a professionally refurbished phone, not something thrown together with fake components. Save yourself the headache, do NOT buy from this seller.

Amazon really does a great job and if you do get a phone through Amazon just do your research on who the seller is because some are out to take your money and give you a lower grade product than what you paid for while other sellers are honest and trustworthy and send you exactly what you paid for.

I recently purchased a phone from your store and opted for the best available option, which was advertised as being in “excellent condition.” While I am generally satisfied with the product, I do have one concern regarding the battery health. The battery capacity is currently at 93%, which, while still decent, does not align with my expectations for a device described as being in “excellent condition.” Typically, I would associate such a description with a battery health rating closer to 100%, especially given that I paid a premium price for this option. I understand that some wear and tear is inevitable, but when a device is marketed as being in “excellent condition,” I believe it should reflect that in all aspects, including battery performance. As a customer, I want to ensure I’m receiving the quality I paid for.

iphone 13 pro max,4,2023-08-04,"Good performance, but disappointing battery health. Title: Good Performance but Disappointing Battery Health - iPhone 13 Pro Max Review Rating: 3.5/5 I recently upgraded from an iPhone 12 Pro Max to the new iPhone 13 Pro Max, and while I'm overall satisfied with its performance and features, there is one aspect that left me disappointed - the battery health. The iPhone 13 Pro Max offers significant improvements in terms of overall performance and features compared to its predecessor. The A15 Bionic chip ensures smooth and snappy performance, and the camera system delivers exceptional image quality. The display is stunning with its vibrant colors and high resolution, providing an immersive viewing experience. The device's build quality is excellent, as expected from Apple, and the design is sleek and premium. However, coming from an iPhone 12 Pro Max with a battery health of 83%, I was hoping for better battery performance with the iPhone 13 Pro Max. Unfortunately, I was disappointed to find that the battery health of my new device was also at 83%. Considering the hefty price tag of the iPhone 13 Pro Max, I expected a better battery health out of the box. That being said, the iPhone 13 Pro Max does offer a longer-lasting battery compared to its predecessor. With moderate usage, I can comfortably get through a full day without needing to recharge. I hope that this battery health issue doesn't lead to the same battery problems I encountered with the iPhone 12 Pro Max, where it struggled to hold a charge effectively. Aside from the battery health concern, the iPhone 13 Pro Max is a powerful and feature-rich device that caters to the needs of tech enthusiasts and professionals alike. The improved performance, exceptional camera capabilities, and stunning display make it a top contender in the smartphone market. In conclusion, the iPhone 13 Pro Max offers an overall positive experience with its impressive performance and features. However, the disappointment lies in the battery health, which was the same as my previous iPhone. I'm hopeful that the battery life remains consistent and doesn't deteriorate rapidly over time. If Apple can address this issue and improve the battery health of their devices, the iPhone 13 Pro Max would unquestionably be a top-notch smartphone choice.",-1,Seller & Carrier Unlockability

There will be no visible cosmetic imperfections when held at an arm’s length."" This part of the product description is entirely inaccurate. There are visible imperfections when held at arm's length, most noticeably damage to the steel in the bottom left corner near the screen. There is also slight damage around the camera lenses, although this is not readily visible at arm's length. In addition to the visible damage, the button on the righthand side functions, but does not have the full range of travel that a new or like new phone has (I'm comparing directly to another iPhone 13 Pro Max I bought new). It's hard to sense sometimes whether you've pressed the button or not.

It was on 3 month old software (iOS 16.5.1 (c). Once I finally managed to get it updated to iOS 17.1, I was able to wipe it (for the 4th or 5th time?) and then go through a normal setup process. I wish it had come with a more recent software version, that would have made setup easier. Battery life is excellent, its battery health is at 90%, which is exactly what I was hoping for with this purchase.

iphone 13 pro max,4,2022-12-23,"Refurbished Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max, 128GB, Gold in Pristine Condition. Was nervous and wasn't sure about ordering any refurbished iPhones outside of Apple's website. Went back and forth before deciding to buy it. Quantity and selection is relatively limited as well as pricing. It was a decent price, very similar to what you find on Apple's website for refurbished iPhones. The item came was shipped with 3 day delivery but came 1 day earlier! :) Signed and opened the package for inspection somewhat nervously. Was surprised to find that the iPhone 13 Pro Max was in relatively pristine condition. No scratches to the screen, to the back or to the side. One of the camera lenses had a slight scratch on the outer rim but doesn't affect performance (see picture). Battery capacity was at 96%, which was good, but fell to 95% after charging. It's Unlocked as noted... 'Carrier Lock... No SIM restrictions'. :) Also included was a short lightning cable and a generic 5W charger, which the latter was useless. The entire phone and box had a slight cigarette smell. Wipe down the phone with soap and water then dry with a microfiber cloth. It still has a slight smell but at least it's been cleaned. What was Missing was the SIM removal tool! Luckily, I had a spare SIM removal tool available. Had to restore and reset the iPhone twice before the clean iOS took effect. It originally included iOS 15.6 which I was hoping to keep and try to update to 15.7.1 but Apple stopped that update and is now forcing newer devices to update to iOS 16.x, currently 16.2! After that, used iTunes for Windows to copy over all the media files to the 13 PM since the restore/reset function literally wipes the iPhone clean. Finally, got lucky and found a Speck clear case on clearance along with a glass screen protector, both at discounted prices, at a nearby Walmart! ;) Currently it's working fine. May update the review if anything else changes.",-1,Screen & Cosmetic Condition

Will continue to buy items sold and shipped by Amazon (below my previous review) I specifically looked for refurbished phone sold and shipped by Amazon hoping would be better than third party sellers. After first use, I noticed that the phone would not receive incoming calls (they would go straight to voicemail). Called service provider and they couldn't help. Called Apple support and they were struggling to understand what it was. Ultimately they said it's either a firmware issue or there is a remote possibility it's hardware problem. I performed update and restore from iTunes and the problem appears to be fixed now. I will keep testing over the next 90 days and decide if return the item or keep it. Shame I had to waste almost a day on the phone and looking for support. Amazon should have tested firmware and software were properly loaded.

iphone 13 pro max,4,2023-09-25,"You need to use a case with this phone at all times. Overall, the phone works as advertised. The camera is great, the interface is simple to use, and call quality is definitely on par when compared to top-tier android flagship devices. The battery life is okay. It can last an entire day on light usage, but in my opinion, I am not satisfied with the battery life. When compared to its competition, android devices in general just have more battery life. With the apple fast charger, charging the phone is much improved, but is still far behind android. The best thing I like about the iphone is the screen design. The screen is completely flat, so it helps when deciding what screen protector to put on it. I do not like it when the screen wraps itself around the phone. It makes the device much more delicate in my experience. I think the iphone is a solid all-around smartphone. The phone is specifically designed to work within the Apple ecosystem and obviously does a solid job of doing so. I do believe iphones are way over priced, but its a supply and demand market so my opinion will not resonate with every single customer. In my experience, there are android devices that can perform in a similar manner at half the price.

iphone 13 pro max,4,2023-09-21,"Everything was perfect! Except….. First I’ll start with the fact that for the past 5 or 6 phones I’ve bought I’ve always bought refurbished wether from Amazon or eBay. I’ve always had good experiences, and never had any issues. This time, the phone arrived, everything was perfect. Tested all the functions and everything worked. However, I noticed a few hours later that the speakers sounded a little “off”. I couldn’t put my finger on it but I knew something was up. I had an iPhone 13 Pro (not the max) and those speakers sounded way better. After further inspection I noticed the bottom facing speakers were caked in what looked like dried earwax! Or vomit or something… 20 minutes later with some isopropyl and a dental pick took care of it though. But it was nasty. Other than that speaker nonsense, everything else was in perfect condition, which shocked me because I didn’t even opt for the “excellent condition” option. I think I chose the middle option so I was expecting at least some scratches but the phone was literally immaculate except for the nasty bottom facing speakers. I’m assuming this is due to a lack of quality control at the third party refurb center. If I didn’t already get rid of my other phone I probably would’ve sent this one back to get replaced.",-1,Battery Life & Charging

I’m happy with it and I’m enjoying the size… a little hefty and the case I have used since my iPhone 11 was redesigned. It puts the camera protector in the way of making good contact with a Magtech charger. Now my only issue is it has 3 scratches on the screen. They are hard to feel with a fingernail, two are only about 1/8 of an inch and down toward the bottom of the screen. The biggest one is less than a 1/2 of an inch but it too is hairline and only noticeable in certain angles.

I could write so much, but it all boils down to apple IOS being about 5-7 years behind developement of android. The ability to customize something as basic as the keyboard (to the effective degree you can in android) is frustratingly absent, and you are stuck with the most basic of keyboards that require you to have to flip through different keyboard screens just to get to common things like a questionmark. Phone specific, the cameras and what not are good, but the screen colors are a tad washed out/pale, and there really isn't a fix for it. All and all, my next phone won't be an iphone, apple IOS is just too archaic and undeveloped compared to android, but the phone is decent enough that I'll hang on to it for a year or so before upgrading, which is something I don't usually do, given my last phone was a Note 9 that I used for 4 years.

iphone 13 pro max,3,2024-06-22,I love everything about it but the speaker quality.. I am assuming it’s because I already have an iPhone 13 that I got a few years ago when they first came out. The problem is that Mr hatefulness got it for me for my birthday and he got it on a payment plan under his name cut the bill then wanted me to pay for my birthday gift he chose to make payments on. I refuse to pay for a gift so I got myself a cheap phone for the time. Now I got this phone. It’s supposed to be excellent quality… But the speaker on this phone is nowhere near as good as my other iPhone 13 Pro Max with 1tb that Mr hatefulness got me but refuses to pay for. I use that phone on WiFi and listen to my music on that phone at home but when I get away from the signal I’m stuck with a crappy speaker phone. 🫨 I guess I expected excellent quality instead of just good quality speaker since I paid for excellent quality phone. Crazy that my old phones speaker works so much better. All in all it’s a great phone I’m just really into music which is why I got the phone with the 1tb memory. So I can save my music to my phone. That and cuz I have like 7 TikTok’s. They keep shutting me down.

There’s two small chips in the front screen, three small chips around the edge of the back glass, scratches and scrapes around the entire edge of the frame, and possibly most importantly is the battery is only at 84 capacity. Now the battery still lasts me all day and then some BUT its very obvious that this phone wasn’t opened, fixed, or renewed at all because at the very least that should have been replaced especially for “excellent” quality.

iphone 14,1,2024-09-19,"1st purchase was great! This one was not!. I have had this iPhone for 38 days. It has the worst battery life of any iPhone I've ever owned, and I have owned ONLY iPhones since the first version was released 17 years ago. This is the second iPhone 14 that I've bought from the renewed store . The first one I bought on December 4th, 2023, and I could not have been happier with the phone. It arrived in brand new condition, and performed flawlessly. On the recommendation of a friend, I checked the battery health and charging after having it for MONTHS and it was at 100%! I was thrilled! I absolutely loved the phone! I never had a single problem with it. Unfortunately, on July 30 of this year I dropped it, and it was beyond repair. I immediately went back to the Amazon renewed store and purchased another iPhone 14 because my experience with the first one was so fantastic. It arrived in new looking condition, exactly like the one I bought in December 2023. It was not scratched or anything really noticeable, it just seemed to be ""worn"" a little bit, but I fully understood that it was a renewed phone, and any cosmetic issues were not that important to me, including the color, which, when my iPhone is in its case, you cannot tell what color it is anyway. Unfortunately, I DID NOT look at the battery health and charging when I first got the phone 38 days ago, but I did look at it about two weeks ago, and it said 93%. I thought, ok, it's a renewed phone, it's not going to have 100% battery life. I can live with that. Well, I just looked at it today and it's now at 90% battery health and charging. So this phone is dying quickly. After being fully charged it dies within hours. I have it completely set up for optimized battery life. I have lost emails and messages that I was in the middle of composing, and the phone just dies. I've been in the middle of important phone calls when the phone dies, simply because I had just fully charged it a few hours before that, and thought I would be fine for hours to come. I just had a total shoulder replacement surgery a week ago, and I was on the phone with my doctors office yesterday about my first post-op appointment, and my phone died in the middle of it. I thought I had HOURS left before the phone would die. Then I had to plug it in, and wait for it to come back alive, so I could call my doctor back and hopefully not wait a half hour after losing my place in line. On top of that is also has issues with the touchscreen being glitchy, and sometimes I have to tap on things several times to get them to work. As I said, I have been an iPhone owner/user since the very first version came out 17 years ago. I've always loved all my iPhones, and I will continue to be an iPhone user for the rest of my life. This is in no way reflection on Apple iPhones whatsoever. They are an amazing and fantastic piece of technology. I think I just got a bad one for the first time in my life. Luckily, I have just checked and I have until November 6th to return this phone, and I WILL be returning it. The problem is, what do I do in the meantime? Am I expected to buy a new one and get that shipped to me, transfer all my information from this phone to the new one, and then return this one? That is extremely hard to do financially! I am actually still paying for this phone on my Amazon Prime American Express card! Or, do I return this phone and wait until the refund has been issued and then buy another phone? Then wait until that is sent to me. I would not have a phone for at least a week in the interim, and we all know these days that's a practical impossibility. I am also having several medical issues. Like I said, I just had a total shoulder replacement surgery last Monday, September 9th, and have several upcoming follow up appointments, and physical therapy appointments. I also have several other non-related medical issues that definitely require that I have a phone. I just don't know what to do.",0,Phone Functionality & Defects
iphone 14,1,2025-03-24,"Non genuine Apple parts used to refurbish iPhone.. I didn’t want to spend $1,000 on a brand-new phone for my older mother, so I thought a $400 refurbished iPhone would be a smart, budget-friendly choice (especially since it would be her first iPhone). We went to our wireless carrier to add her to my plan, and right off the bat, the phone was set to a different language. It took two employees 15 minutes just to switch it to English. We proceeded with transferring her phone number over and basic setup of the phone. When we got home, I created an Apple ID for her and tried to add her emai…then I saw a red notification in Settings that said, “Unknown Part.” Tapping it revealed a message stating “Unable to verify if display is a genuine Apple part.” Are you serious? So now, after spending my entire Sunday setting everything up, I’m going to have to undo it all and return this phone. I’m furious. Beyond furious. My mom doesn’t understand phone plans; my dad handled all of that, and he passed away recently. I added her to my plan to help her and to make sure that she has reliable way of communicating since I moved to Texas, and she’s back in California. We set up her phone during her one-week visit out here and she is set to fly home tomorrow. The phone is already tied to mine and my husbands plan, and her plan she had with my father is cancelled. And for anyone who has ever dealt with changes on a phone plan knows that the main account holder is the person who has to do everything. Which means I will need to send my mother home without a phone until we get a new phone and I drag my husband once again down to the store to connect the new phone, I’ll have to reset up the new phone and then mail it from Texas to her in California. And all the while, will have no way of contacting her… and she will have a phone to contact anyone. The fact that the phone was repaired using non-genuine Apple parts completely derailed everything. This wasn’t an accident—it was deliberate. The seller knowingly passed off a product with unauthorized repairs as a legitimate iPhone and charged accordingly. That’s not just misleading—it’s fraud. A simple refund isn’t enough. This seller should be removed from Amazon Prime, and Amazon needs to do a better job vetting Prime sellers. I’ve always trusted Amazon to ensure its Prime vendors are reputable, but clearly, that trust was misplaced. Lesson learned.",0,Phone Functionality & Defects
iphone 14,1,2024-05-20,"Overall very good, but if you need tech support it becomes a pain. UPDATE: After speaking to a very helpful agent at Loop Mobile, the company who deals with these refurbishments, I discovered my phone was still under warranty and they would replace for free. However I needed to send my phone in first, before they would ship me a new one. I use my phone for work so this is a problem, but I can make it work for a few days. I'm told the turnaround is very fast too, so I figure I'm looking at a week maximum. Due to a tracking error on FedEx's end, it takes them longer to process my return, so it's nearly a week and a half before I get my new phone. And then when I get it, it's set up for TMobile, not AT&T so I can't even use it. And all attempts to call this week have been met with a message of ""no available agents, call back later"". They have been relatively fast to respond via email, but honestly, this has been such a mess I'm wishing I had just spent some extra money for a new phone. I know there is always a risk with refurb items, but I've rarely had issue and when I do they are resolved quickly. I purchased a refurbished iPhone 14 in August of last year and it was working great with no issues. It was a like new phone. However, in the last few days I've started getting ""Unknown Battery"" messages and my phone will turn off at random multiple times throughout the day, to the point where I don't feel confident making phone calls with the phone for fear of them being dropped. I went back to the order to see what my options were in terms of warranty and tech support, and it's EXTREMELY convoluted. It's hard for me to even tell if I qualify for the 90 day guarantee or the 1 year, because my phone was classified as ""new"" but the Amazon site only lists guarantees for conditions which are premium, excellent, or acceptable. When I tried to chat with someone I found my message was sent over to Loop Mobile, who must be the third party company who actually refurbished the phone. But it's unclear who I need to contract to see how to get this fixed or if I just need to pay out of pocket. I haven't even had the phone a year, so it's a disappointing development for what has otherwise been a great phone.",-1,Phone Functionality & Defects
iphone 14,1,2025-05-01,"Consider other sellers with better consistency and quality. I should have taken the reviews seriously that mentioned that there are inconsistencies with the actual quality of phone you receive. Even if you pay more for the “excellent” condition version, this does not fully mean the device you will receive is in excellent condition. I ordered an iPhone 14 and after a day after unboxing I realized that the charging port was faulty. At first I thought it wasn’t charging because it was in set up mode, but turns out it didn’t work in Bernal even after trying several phone chargers. How can the seller consider the iPhone in excellent condition and held by Amazon Renewed standards when a major component of the device doesn’t work. I had to use the MagSafe wireless charging to keep the device charged, which required me to buy the alternative charger. Communicating with the seller about an exchange felt like a void. It took a month to “resolve” which ended with me sending back the phone and the seller, without notice or explanation, issuing a refund instead of the exchange we agreed on. When I asked why, they said they “ran out”, but somehow I was able to reorder the exact model and specs IPhone right after our exchange, which costed me $10more. I still haven’t received the phone, but will update with another review once I receive the second device. Overall, budget customer service and inconsistent quality.

Excellent condition promises no visible (from 12 inches away) cosmetic issues or damage. This is very visible at 36 inches, let alone 12.

iphone 14,2,2024-10-06,"Better off getting a new one. All of this was experienced in the span of about 24-48 hours, and due to my work, I couldn’t keep the device because of the performance issues experienced: I needed a phone quick because my last phone died. While I appreciate the quick turn around on my order and delivery, the device had issues. For starters, the refurbished one I ordered and received took a long time to set up. You couldn’t just pair it with another device to get everything transferred. If you tried this, you would see the latest update would take days to complete and the timeline never changed. I reached out to apple and they helped me get it set up, however, there were several performance issues with the device I received. Total time it took to get the phone set up: 6.5 hours. Details: Started at 4pm as soon as the device was delivered, and after seeing the update was still not completed around 9pm, I worked with Apple support to get the device finally set up around 10pm. Performance issues: The charging port was loose, so even if the device was connected to a plug in charger, it wouldn’t always charge. This also impacted connection to CarPlay when driving. The phone would be sitting in the seat beside me, plugged in, but if it moved slightly, the connection wouldn’t work and I’d have to unplug it and plug it back in. It’s not tight enough to keep a good connection. There was an issue with screen responsiveness and phantom typing. If you needed to tap or select anything closer to the edge of the screen, it wouldn’t register. At times the screen wouldn’t respond at all, or if it was face down and I picked it up, I would see it was randomly typing characters in the Home Screen search box. I would have to manually turn the screen off (side button) for it to stop. There was also an issue with the front facing camera and sensor. The camera was really fuzzy and not able to pick up anything at times. The sensor wouldn’t always correctly adjust the screen brightness over the night I had it. The physical device itself also has scratches and dents all over it. While I don’t care about cosmetic as much as the above, the phone I received was more along the lines of poor condition overall. For this seller, I think it would be a good idea to do more intensive performance testing with the phones/devices before you send them out. You should also include correct setup instructions with the devices so your customers can set them running with ease and not have to waste half a day trying to get the phone setup to work. Overall, with the issues and hassle I experienced with the device I was sent, it was more cost effective to go buy the same model in new condition for the additional $100 at a local Best Buy.",0,Battery Life & Charging

The product, itself, was great; and it worked very well from when I bought it until Dec 6 when I was alerted that someone had been trying to call me and call was going straight to voicemail. When I looked at my phone, it was in SOS mode. Talks with customer reps from our service provider, Tello, and later Xfinity, I was informed that my refurbished, unlocked phone used to be with Verizon and Verizon locked it. No additional details on why; however, since it was working for some time, Xfinity customer rep surmised that previous owner must have reported it lost or stolen. These are the typical reasons for why phone would be locked. I chose to get a brand new phone from service provider for expediency, as I don't have a landline nor another mobile phone to use. As of Dec 11, I have a new working phone. I have initiated a return of the phone; there was no reason for return in the drop-down menu that truly applies to why. I chose ""No longer needed"", as that was the one closest to why I was returning the item. I think that Amazon should bear some responsibility for selling refurbished, unlocked phones. It appears that ""unlocked"" status does not guarantee that it will remain unlocked, as was my case. Previous owner may still report to service provider that phone was lost or stolen, in which case the service provider locks the phone.",-1,Phone Functionality & Defects

Mine is 88% for the excellent condition. I just hope this lasts, as I bought it for use in Peru and not the states. So, charging your phone is a whole lot less convenient when not in the US, surrounded by chargers and plugs/outlets.

It would be fine for days to a week or so, but then would shut its self off randomly despite how much charge the phone had. Then would turn its self on, & repeat this process until the battery completely died & got very hot. This happened about 3 times before I was able to actually initiate the return. Even though I had to return the phone, I’m leaving 4 stars because customer service was great. I was able to get a complete refund very easily. They made the return process very quick & smooth & was issued a full refund as soon as they received the phone in the mail. I purchased from this seller in the past, & would still use this seller again. This phone came in almost brand new condition. There was one super small 2 mm scratch on the screen, but it is not deep, barely noticeable & does not affect function. Cameras are great, battery life came at 99%, holds a charge very well!! Overall great phone, & got here quick. It did not come with an Apple charger, but the listing says that it does not. This is not a big deal to me at all, as I have a bunch laying around.

I will say the packaging it came in wasn’t that great at all! But it didn’t affect the phone.

The flaw that bugs the heck out of me wasn’t the sellers fault. It is Apple’s fault. They put the power button directly opposite of the volume controls. Seems nearly every time I pick up the phone the natural inclination for your fingers is to wrap around the phone resulting in pressing volume and power simultaneously and taking a screen shot.

I haven't had it long enough to comment on things like battery life yet. My old iPhone had a physical SIM card so most of my contacts were stored on that and I still haven't found a way to easily transfer all my numbers from my old phone en masse and keep on having to airdrop contacts from my old phone to my new phone every time an unrecognised number appears as a caller or text message. The touch screen is TOO responsive in certain apps so, for example, if I rotate the phone whilst watching Youtube videos on the phone, if I'm not super careful, it suddenly skips to the next video or hits a rewind. I've also found it problematic if I'm writing a text and using the sweep action on the keyboard and make a mistake, when I hit the delete button two words (or more) back get deleted. I've also found the camera doesn't want to focus on close up photos...

Now even though I am giving a negative review, let me first say that despite my glaring issue the phone works and turns on great. It came in pretty much new condition and was nicely wrapped and shipped fast. The price is great too for the quality of the phone I received, assuming that I did not have this severe issue, I would easily rate this 5 stars. The issue for me came when it became time to activate my phone with my carrier. At first I was confused as for whatever reason I could not get it to activate on apple at all. I eventually set up without being able to transfer anything over from my previous phone or logging into my apple account which was already annoying but whatever, I'm not the best with technology anyways. Since I couldn't directly transfer my stuff over from apple, I went to the verizon (my carrier) website and tried to manually activate it by adding in the device ID and eSIM card however I was greeted with an error message. I assumed I was just having a ""skill issue"" and resolved to take it to the verizon store the next day, when I got there once again the phone itself worked great but the clerk told me it was impossible for him to activate it. Why? Because the phone was on the ""Non-pay list,"" meaning that since this phone was used, whoever used it before had simply decided not to pay their bills and since they turned it in, now I am the one facing the consequences for their choices. Perhaps this is not loops fault but nonetheless, I was sold a $500+ phone that I have no use for and I would like to warn others, you too may be sold a phone that is locked out of your carrier, creating a rather expensive brick to decorate a drawer.",-1,Phone Functionality & Defects

I asked if they could send a replacement and I send this one back but was told I can’t do that. So now I have to go w/o a phone and no money.

What I can say is please do better research than what I did and always know that buying online without being able to inspect the phone and see it’s condition before purchase is a risk that depending on who you are could be a slight annoyance to a major issue when you find that the phone arrived in a condition where it is not as promised.

iphone 14 plus,1,2024-04-25,"Beware: Disappointing Experience with iPhone 14+ Purchase. I recently purchased two iPhone 14+ devices through Amazon and unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory. While the price seemed decent initially, the troubles that followed made it a regrettable decision. One of the iPhones I received did not set up as expected; it consistently entered a reboot loop for no apparent reason during the setup process. Despite multiple attempts to reset the device, the issue persisted, rendering the phone unusable. In an effort to resolve the issue, I removed the phone from iCloud and tried various troubleshooting methods to no avail. Consequently, I had no choice but to initiate a return for the malfunctioning device. What added to the frustration was the discovery of a restocking fee that was not mentioned during the initial purchase. This fee significantly reduced the amount I received as a refund, leaving me with very little compensation for the hassle and inconvenience caused by the faulty device. Overall, my experience with purchasing an iPhone 14+ through Amazon was disappointing and costly.

I have read and watch many solutions to this problem. I went into Settings - General – Reset iPhone and I reset it. Once the phone did a complete restart the screen showed a message stating that the screen is not a compatible Apple part so in other words, the screen has been replaced with a substandard part.

The phone had scratches on its back, scuffs on its side, no physical SIM slot (US version), a misplaced screen protector, and a ""good"" at best battery. I thought, as my second purchase, the previous issues would have been fixed. This was not the case; again, there was an absence of a SIM card slot (since it’s a US model). meaning I have to now go out my way to purchase an e-sim. Given the price I paid, I expected a much better-quality device. This should have been rated as acceptable to good at best. Overall, I feel like I overpaid for a product that didn’t live up to expectations. It was described as being in excellent condition, but in my opinion, ""acceptable/good"" would have been more appropriate for this phone. The description did not include the obvious scuffs and scratches on the iPhone.

There were quite a lot of scratches on the body and screen. The battery health was only at 85%, which is noticeably worn for the price point.

The arrived a day earlier than Amazon predicted in a plain white box with a generic wall charger & USB-A to Lightning cable. I do wish they had done more to protect the phone, as it was just in a bubble-wrap sleeve, and the box was quite large, leaving the phone to just rattle around and bump into the particularly pointy prongs on the wall charger. There are a few scuffs on the screen that don't buff out with a microfiber cloth, but I don't know if that's because of the poor packaging or because it's a refurbished phone. I plan to put a screen protector on it anyway, so I'm not too concerned. This device IS refurbished. I wasn't expecting perfect, but the phone's condition did meet expectation. There are a few visible dings on the outside edge of the phone, and there are a few scuffs on the screen. The device powered on immediately, although the battery was nearly depleted, so a trip to a power receptacle was necessary. The phone only prompted me for my language, promptly dropping me on the home screen. This is my first foray with IOS devices, so being unsure about its lack of setup questions I went into Settings and did a factory reset. After going through a more thorough and proper setup, I checked both the battery health and warranty. The battery is at 97%, so it's definitely been used, but still within expectations. There's also still 4 months of warranty left from Apple! Overall, as long as you purchase this device with the understanding that it is refurbished, not new, then I believe this is a good choice for people who want the new iPhone experience without paying the full Apple Tax for a brand new device. I am a little concerned about the lack of initial setup questions (I work in an industry with a heavy focus on cyber security, so I'm a little paranoid about that stuff!) but it's easy enough to be absolutely sure that you're getting a freshly wiped device.

Tengo casi dos meses de uso con mi iPhone 14 Pro, estaba muy asustada por pedir un producto reacondionado, pensé que me iban a estafar, cuando abrí la caja y vi lo simple que venía empacado, me dije “hice una compra muy estúpida” (especialmente porque no me salió nada barato, con todo e impuestos el precio se elevó), pero observé el teléfono y todo estaba en excelente condición, habían solo dos rayones en la pantalla, casi ni se notaban solo si lo pones a contraluz, todo lo demás estaba perfecto, revisé el estado de la batería y estaba al 100% de su capacidad. Después de todo el tiempo de uso, me di cuenta que la cámara tiene un pequeño error de desenfoque y se lo adjudiqué a ser un producto “reacondionado”, pero luego de hacer una investigación exhaustiva, puedo concluir que no es por el hecho de ser un producto reacondionado sino un defecto del iPhone 14 Pro, ya que más personas han reportado el mismo error en la cámara en productos nuevos de la tienda de Apple. Entonces, puedo concluir que el teléfono vino en excelentes condiciones, es totalmente funcional, el producto es lo que promete la publicación, pero pero recomiendo investigar el producto antes de comprarlo ya que puede que el producto venga con fallas de fábrica, es decir, no por ser reacondionado. Y pues, también recomiendo cotizar más el precio, ya que puede que los productos “nuevos” estén a su alcance en cuanto a precio, ya que si ahorras un poco más puedes conseguir un producto nuevo, pero si tu presupuesto no te da, esta es una buena opción de compra.",0,Screen & Cosmetic Condition

The screens auto brightness feature doesn’t work, as well as when they fixed the screen for refurbishment they obviously didn’t do it properly because it has no True Tone feature. Also I’m guessing the messed up when putting the screen back together in some way as the front facing camera has a sort of fogginess around it, although it doesn’t affect the cameras performance. Those features not being active is a bit of a let down and the OCD of the fogginess in the selfie camera is just irritating.

iphone 14 pro,4,2023-12-22,"Battery Life So-So on 1TB Option. I didn't see any reviews for anyone buying the 1TB model, so here is one! I purchased this phone THREE times to try and get one with a Maximum Battery Capacity that was acceptable. I saw people in reviews complaining about 92% - I wish! The first one I got had a max of 85%. My iPhone 12 Pro that is nearly 3 years old is at 85%... it seems if you are selling a refurbished phone that is a little over a year old and marked as ""excellent condition"" then it should have a higher capacity than a 3 year old phone. I ordered the phone again hoping the battery was a fluke, but phone 2 was only slightly better at 88%. I went for 'third try's a charm' and ordered again. This last one was at 92%. I decided that was the best I was going to get. The phone has otherwise been functioning great the last month. Very minimal scratches. Apple will do a battery replacement without any Apple Care coverage for a flat $99. So taking this $850 phone and maybe one day paying $99 for another batter is still a better deal than an additional $600 to get the 1TB iPhone 15 Pro model. So overall this is still a good deal and I had a very good experience with returning to 2 phones I chose not to keep.

The phone arrived in exceptionally good condition, and I must say, it looks and feels like a brand new device. The battery health is at 93%, which is slightly below what I expected, aiming for 95% and above. However, considering the phone's performance, it's evident that it has hardly been used. The camera functions flawlessly, capturing crisp and clear images. One remarkable aspect is the difficulty in finding any scratch marks. It took me a week to notice them, showcasing how minor they are. This emphasizes the meticulous refurbishment process, ensuring that the phone maintains a near-new appearance. While I had a slight expectation for a higher battery health percentage, the overall quality, functionality, and the minimal signs of wear make this purchase entirely worth the investment.

iphone 14 pro,4,2023-12-22,"Good phone, but overpriced compared to other similar offers. Got this renewed and it was really well packed and like new; beside some minor flaws and little scratches. The main thing I can say about it though is that it is very overpriced; and that is no surprise if you are an Apple fan. Features compared to same phones of the same period are more expensive, so you may want to give it a go first. If you are switching from Android, you will see this more easily; but for Apple users it has value and the new features added are useful and worthwhile. Screen is fine overall, and this is the same exact phone you get year after year, a bit faster, with less and less connections (even the SIM card slot is gone... ), so nothing new here. Performances are great; it can handle most of what you throw at it basically.

The phone itself was in good condition, there were a few smudges on the side, but that was wiped off easily. The little film that's on top of the phone was dirty, I didn't really mind about that though. The thing that really disappointed me was the battery life. The phone is 88% battery life. I would expect more from a one year old phone, but that's average after a year, I'd expect a higher battery life and I know I wouldn't get anything better if I replaced it. Another thing I didn't like was the cheap chinese brick and cable, in 5 minutes it wouldn't even go up by 1%! If you buy this product, make sure to buy a good cable and brick as well.

iphone 14 pro,1,2024-09-19,"For a ""Refurbished - Excellent"" product, I was severely disappointed!. First off, the the phone was delivered in a box inside of a box with no paper, no styrofoam, no bubblewrap, nothing. It was just flopping around inside of the box. That really set the mood for the rest of my experience. Secondly, there was no paperwork, just an iPhone and a charger, absolutely zero documentation of any kind. Sure it's easy to set up an iPhone and you don't really need any documentation to do so, but I'd at least like to know who sent me my product. Third, once the iPhone was set up it seemed to be in great condition. However the more I used it the more I realized it was junk. The display was absolutely not 120hz, it barely looked 60hz, but that may have been because the operating system of the iPhone was running very poorly, probably because it has been repaired with cheap, non-genuine parts. The front facing camera had very poor picture quality, so much so that the facial recognition refused to work for me. The touch screen was absolutely awful. My shattered iPhone 11 is easier to use. When scrolling, it would jump along without being able to smoothly follow my finger. Typing was a hassle because it would struggle to register my taps, and when it did it often input double characters and whatever letter was near what I was tapping. Good luck trying to type a password with that phone. Oh, and the battery health was a nice 70% when I checked it. Lastly, I don't know who the actual merchant is for this product. Depending on which options you choose, you'll end up buying from a different merchant. Before purchasing my product it said it was sold by Amazon.com, now with the exact same options it says it's DirectCertified.

When I received it and got it out of the box I noticed it had a lot of scuffing along the edges and wear on the side buttons. I was a little bummed it looked so used already, but not a huge deal because I would put a case on it anyways, right? So I continue phone set up and everything went great. I did notice the phone was already getting a little hot while I was using it, so that had me a little worried. I realized I hadn’t taken a picture yet to see how much better the quality was than the 12 pro I had previously been using. This is where I ran into major issues with the phone. The camera will not focus at all. I can toggle the lens focal length in and out and somewhat get it to focus for a short second, but other than that… nothing. So I insist the lenses and the bottom left lens looks odd. If you look close it looks damaged or like it has glue rubbed on it, or replaced with some kind of cheap plastic lens. I can’t figured out what exactly was done to this lens, but it does not work! I compared to a family members iPhone 14 Pro and that lens doesn’t look like hers does that works perfectly. I’m pretty upset they let a refurbished phone in this condition be resold to someone, especially when I selected the “excellent condition” option when purchasing.

Upon arrival, it has scratches on the front and rear and along the bottom edge on the right side is missing the silver and feels rough like the phone has been previously dropped. There was also a glue like substance around all of the camera lenses on the back. The phone came in a box that wasn’t sealed properly. The charging cord that came in the box does not fit this phone, like WTH. Good thing I had a iPhone charger from my previous phone or I’d be screwed. The phone should not be considered “excellent” just on the physical appearance alone. Now, the battery health is at 84%, which is low in my opinion. When I charged the phone for the first time, it would not charge past 80%. I tried again a few hours later and it charges so slow, on my fast charger. My last gripe is that when I was setting up my phone with my iCloud every so often a pop up would say that “This device is associated with another iCloud” and that it can only be linked to a different account every 90 days, there is a countdown that I have to wait 68 days. This is crazy. Some of the options are not there because the phone is on another account. I don’t think I should be having these problems. I should be happy getting a phone, but it’s been a headache. My last excellent condition refurbished iPhone was purchased on eBay and everything about that experience and the quality of that phone (it was like new with no scratches and physically perfect) and battery health was at 90% excellent.

In any event, because my phone number had already been ported to this faulty phone, I had no phone service. Had to go and purchase a new SIM card.

They provided me with an address to return the phone but when I asked for a prepaid label, they said they would provide one and never sent it. That was 7 days ago.

The second one had the exact same problem. I sent that one back and ended up buying a new iPhone 15 Pro from the Apple Store. Today, I received a message from the seller that they received my return but will not refund my purchase. They are claiming that the unit that I returned was not purchased from them!?! I told them they had mistaken and it was indeed purchased from them and definitely nobody else! I even sent them screen shots of the ESN screens before I sent it back.

There are pitted scratches all around the front and back edges and the two right corners are really bad someone obviously dropped it and it rolled on concrete or other rough surface. Two corners are scratched obviously and visible from 5’ away and I don’t even have 20/20 vision.

There are some dings on the corners and overall just not in the condition it was claimed to be. Battery was at 96% health and the screen seems to work fine, maybe a little less sensitive than I expected. The phone was not packed well, just a small bit of packing material that allowed the phone to rattle around in the box.

This phone was sold as unlocked only to arrive with passcode which meant I could not use it beyond just switching it on. The anxiety that followed is unparalleled! I engaged seller who although they were responsive didn't offer me a solution beyond try iTunes or send it back for a refund. I then engaged Apple Support who were much more supportive, tried to walk me through the process to restore it although we didn't succeed . They then suggested I walk in to my nearest Apple Store which is eventually what worked, thankfully the phone had no iCloud connected to it despite still having the passcode. The phone itself is great so far, I don't see any scratches or obvious faults. Battery health is actually still at 100% which is awesome.

iphone 14 pro max,1,2025-03-11,"Multiple Problems. I bought 2 phones on February 14th. One for me and one for my fiancé. Mine was delivered in 5 days and was in perfect condition, I love it. My fiancé’s was not delivered until March 5th. Obviously, I spent a lot of money on these phones. When his was delivered and opened, the first thing we noticed was there was already a screen protector on the phone and it was cracked in 2 different places. The next thing we noticed was that the phone would not charge using a wireless charger. His phone also runs out of battery super fast despite the battery life being 95%. The battery only lasts him 3 hours max while using the phone, compared to the one that I got that lasts 2 days before having to charge it and I use mine more than he uses his. His phone keeps freezing and does not allow him to use the screen until he turns the phone off and then back on. I am happy with the phone I received, but the experience with the one he got has been nothing but trouble. Overall, not very happy with my purchase all together and now out of the money that was spent. When you spend $1300 on a product ($650 each) you expect something that actually works decently. To be clear, we didn’t expect something perfect, but having this many issues is outrageous.",-1,Battery Life & Charging

The iPhone arrived in a damaged box and it had some imperfections on the metal frame however since is a refurbished phone I figure that was normal. I kept the phone cause it was a hassle returning it and the phone seemed to work fine. However after 5 months of use the phone is heavily malfunctioning. The buttons started glitching and now they straight up don’t work. I have to use my headphone and control the volume with them because the side buttons don’t work. As well as the Lock Screen button. I have to leave my phone “on” at all times until it goes to sleep cause the button doesn’t work. I have tried to use my protection plan and it sent me to use the Apple support which will be incurre additional fees and cost. As I am currently paying for insurance through Amazon I don’t understand why they just don’t seem to want to honor it. I would love to hear back from the seller about an exchange or refund.

Not a scratch on it. I was switching from a 13 Non-pro & started the fairly automated IOS phone swap procedure. It took several tries but got it switched. The eSIM transfer was the easiest part actually. Then the bad news came. Once the phone was installing all my apps etc. I checked the capacity of the battery and the storage. I ordered 1TB specifically so I would never run out of space creating content & the added cost worth it to me. Imagine my surprise when I saw I had in fact only 256 which was what I was coming from. To make things worse I checked the Battery health capacity & found it to be only 84% max. My 2 plus year old 13 had 94% max still and that’s not being gentle with charge cycles. I know 80%+ is still considered a Very good. Rating for max battery capacity but one of the reasons I went with the Pro Max was for the added battery capacity. Very disappointed beyond words given the hassle it was to switch over phones this far. I immediately submitted a request for a refund.

It was packaged okay and it was the only thing in the box, it did not come with a charger. Kinda bummed about that but it's fine, I have chargers at home. Once I got the phone turned on, everything was fine until I noticed that it did not have a sim card tray. I was unaware that the 14 Pro Max didn't use a sim card so that was my fault. I debated returning the phone for a lower model with a sim card option but I changed my mind and I got everything transferred over to eSim through my carrier. After that absolute headache, everything seemed to be working fine and then my screen started to randomly black out. If the sun hits my screen or I answer a call the screen immediately turns off (without my head near the sensor and on speakerphone). I did some troubleshooting and of course there's nothing online other than to update it or it must be a hardware issue. My luck would seem that's a hardware issue. As of right now, I've had this phone for close to a month and it blacks out every day. It's extremely frustrating because I don't/can't fork out $700 for another phone. As for the phone itself, it was fine visually, no major scratches. The battery life states ""100%"" and it charges as it should. The black tones in the phone are off meaning they're more for a gray and not completely black, like in the notes app on dark mode. I can't say that I'll buy another phone on Amazon.

You could fix it by turning the screen off and on, the recommended fix is a software update. I went to do that and it turned itself off and got stuck on the apple logo only after I force turned it off while it was already off. Now it’s plugged into my pc and I’m forcing a update with iTunes, if that doesn’t work I’ll have to wipe the entire phone, and if that doesn’t work I’m returning it because it’s a hardware issue.

iphone 15,1,2024-10-26,"Defective phone.. The phone itself is nice. It didn’t come in the original apple box or with the original apple charger, but to be completely honest I did not care about that. I was just looking forward to the phone itself. Let me explain the 1 star. Not even one or two hours of having it, it already began malfunctioning. I had immediately gone to my mobile carrier to get it activated, and it started turning off and on on its own, same as the video provided. For majority of the first day, I couldn’t even access it or even get to the lock screen. It would load up the logo as if it’s turning on, and then turn off immediately, and do it again for the rest of the day. At the end of the night, I was able to get it to load up to the lock screen. At this point, I just wanted to return it but at least erase all the information I had transferred in the very beginning. After a couple of days finding a way to fully erase, I was able to do so successfully. Today, I just returned it. I got the phone October 23, and it is October 26. Mind you, I had requested the return the day of the delivery, I just needed to find a way to make sure NONE of my information was in the phone when returning it. The picture of it in the box is most recent of when I was able to repackage it to return it. Overall, disappointed in this order. I was excited, expecting a fine, normal functioning phone as everyone has been only mentioning good about it. I do not recommend. I’ll definitely just stick to buying original phones in store. If you need a new phone, just spend the extra few hundred dollars to buy a brand new one than to deal with one that may malfunction like this. Better safe than sorry.",-1,Battery Life & Charging

So this same phone , color , and storage is around 1300 plus from Apple not to mention if you’re even lucky enough to find it in stock. With that being said I did pay around 200-300 less ,which is a pro , however there is some cons . Cons ; shipping took about 1 week which isn’t long , just long for Amazon . Also phone was refurbished so there was sadly some small knicks on the top of the phone frame but nothing to crazy , screen was almost perfect , had super minor scratches but wouldn’t even be able to see if you cleaned it good and like us had a screen protector , The review that says it wasn’t unlocked is wrong , phone just needed to be brought to Metro or whatever carrier you’re taking it to and they charge 25 plus tax to activate it , Will all that I think those minor inconveniences was worth the 300 dollar discount you get for buying a refurbished phone with Amazon , I hope this review helped .

iphone 15 plus,1,2025-05-03,"Not worth it. Very disappointing.. Day 2 with this phone and I would give it 3 stars I would give 5 but the screen is having calibration issues like when I press one button it’s pressing g another so that is very frustrating. The phone came in good condition. The phone was unlocked on all carriers so I was able to choose which one I wanted very easily. The phone does heat up pretty fast when I charge it even if it’s only on the charger for 15 mins the phone will automatically stop charging because of the temperature until it drops, so I’m not sure how durable it will be in the future. I can tell this screen was replaced it’s not as vivid as a brand new iPhone but you get what you pay for I guess. It’s a good phone I just wish the screen was calibrated better and also wish the phone didn’t overheat while charging. Other than that as far as how it looks and the description it came exactly how they said it would just some minor issues you may come across. Update less than a month later : I woke up one day and my screen just stopped working, like I can hear people calling me I can feel text vibrating etc but it is completely blacked out and not working. Never dropped the phone or damaged it. It just stopped working one day. This phone was about $670 I believe and brand new it may retail for about $200 or so more. Save yourself the trouble and just get a brand new phone. People work too hard for their money for these types of inconveniences. I would highly recommend to stay away from this buyer and go to an actual phone store. I just put in a request for a refund today as it happened this morning so I will come back with another update on that progress. I had 3 stars at first now I’m changing it to 1. Really sad because I wanted to love this phone as it is so nice looking but the mechanical issues make it impossible for use. Update on return: returning the phone was super easy I got the full refund because I returned phone in the condition it was received and it was less than 90 days since my purchase! I feel sorry for people who have experienced the same issues as me but couldn’t get refunds because it was more than 90 days. But I did end up buying a brand new 16 plus directly from Apple for about $200 more than this used phone so I highly suggest if you have to money to pay for a used phone you can just pay the few extra hundred for a brand new phone that comes with more security should anything go wrong.. hope this helps anyone out there looking..",0,Battery Life & Charging
iphone 15 plus,1,2024-11-10,"A complete headache for me!. I purchased this phone a few weeks ago as my old phone broke. When I received the phone (day 1) the screen sticks and after researching the way to fix this is resetting the phone. After having to reset it multiple times a day (by day 3) I said I can’t keep doing this. I contacted the seller and they said they’d be happyyyy (exaggerated) to replace it I would have to have to go through Amazon customer service to submit a replacement request. Contacted customer service and they cannot do a replacement request my only option is a refund. Well that would lead me without a phone and now the prices have increased for another. I purchased the insurance so I take it to the repair company. Well that’s going to cost me… why should I pay for an issue that I had no control of. The phone does have a limited warranty, so the guy told me to take it to Apple. I took it to Apple. They run the diagnostic and they said nothing is wrong and that I just needed to updated to the newest IOS. Next day it still sticks. I take it back to Apple and after running a deeper diagnostics I now have to get a full replacement but they do not have the replacement in store and have to order it in. I come back to get the replacement and as he is submitting the service ticket it will not allow him and says the phone has to be sent in and will take them a week. Long story short I’m back to my broken phone and cannot get a new one or this one fixed.

More concerning is that the display runs at only 60Hz instead of the ProMotion 120Hz expected from the Pro model, which is disappointing and likely a result of the screen replacement. Additionally, the iPhone 15 Pro is known for heat issues, and this unit is no exception. Given the third-party battery, I can’t be certain if this is normal or worsened.

So I took the time to write this review because I want to let you guys know what you'll get. I was super skeptical and read all of your guys's reviews and finally decided to check it out myself. Here's what I found: Pros: 100% battery life Everything works as should Cons: Bad packaging (simple box and no protection for the phone) Scratches on the screen (mine had an unpleasant streak on the bottom left corner of the screen; not noticeable when putting the phone in front, but when I would tilt it to the light it would show) No Apple Care or Warranty My conclusion is: just don't buy this company's phone (Bid Allies) ALWAYS try to buy from actual AMAZON RENEWED (it comes with Apple Care and Warranty and nicer packaging) and make sure it's premium quality or actually excellent condition Hope this helps you all save time and money! :)",-1,Screen & Cosmetic Condition

iphone 15 pro,1,2025-03-30,"Low quality phone and purchasing experience. This is the 5th time I’ve posted this review as for some reason Amazon keeps removing an honest review. TLDR: I wouldn’t recommend purchasing given quality of phone (scratched/poor battery health for price point) as well as customer service from the seller. I bought the iPhone 15 Pro in excellent condition for $770 from BuySpry, and there were already issues with the phone arriving late when my current phone had died due to the battery in the cold. The phone that arrived had numerous scratches on the display hidden by a screen protector (which seems to be a pattern based on other reviews shown), dirt/debris in the charging port, as well as a battery with 91% health and 320+ battery cycles already used. I was surprised given the number of reviews for excellent phones with 95%+ health and low battery cycles. Further, scratches on the display do NOT qualify as Excellent/Good quality phones according to Amazon Renewed guidelines. The real issue came when trying to resolve with the seller. Each response took 1-2 days with constant follow up on my end, and mind you I did not have a functional phone at this point. They refused to do a partial refund, and eventually also refused to send a replacement phone, stating that “there was no availability left.” I attached a screenshot I took the very next day, which showed that indeed I could receive a phone from the same seller by next day delivery. Overall I experienced a lack of empathy/basic customer service. Would not recommend given the hassle and overall experience. I’ve been dedicated to posting an honest review for potential buyers of all that happened in the 2 weeks it took to get this resolved, and even getting this post approved/posted has been trying to say the least.",-1,Phone Functionality & Defects
iphone 15 pro,1,2025-05-23,"I would never recommend this.. I would never recommend this. I purchased an iPhone 15 Pro Max 512GB, and initially, everything appeared to be in perfect condition. However, I soon started experiencing issues with location services. At first, I thought it was a problem with the Maps app, so I tried using other navigation apps — but the same frustrating issue persisted. Eventually, I realized the problem was with the phone itself, not the apps. I hoped a software update might resolve it, assuming it was a software glitch, but even after updates, the issue remained. It’s clearly a problem with the phone’s location services. I contacted the dealer, but they informed me that the return window had passed and there was nothing they could do. If you're considering buying a phone from here, be cautious — some issues might not be immediately obvious. Now, I’m forced to carry my old phone just to use maps, which is incredibly frustrating as I travel frequently. I’ll likely need to replace this phone entirely, which means spending even more money.

The screen seemed to barely respond to touch input and would only briefly flash a password screen for a fraction of a second. I was also not able to bring up the slider to turn the phone off. I was able to get the phone to restart with volume up, volume down and holding power but I never could get it to shutdown. Also, the back of the phone was unusually warm the entire time it was on. Amazon should at least verify that a phone powers on and off before labeling it “like new”. UPDATE - After returning the first Iphone 15 Pro, I ordered another one from Amazon Resale. This time they sent me a iPhone 12 pro 512mb when I had ordered a iPhone 15 Pro 1TB.

I also checked for the repair history and no parts were replaced according to the iPhone’s history.

Since this is a refurbished phone I received all 3rd party accessories such as iphone box, usb-c cable, usb-c 20w adapter, screen protector.

There is a lot to love about Android and I am sorry I made this change hoping for the relief from Android woes!!! From the frying pan into the fire! First, I couldn’t figure out how to press numbers when I was called by my friend in prison who had an automated “accept this call press zero…. The numbers would not register. I called Apple and the girl took me all over the phone and this was on the last day of return. The next call from my friend there was NOTHING registering on my keypad again. I almost smashed this phone with a hammer! So I searched YouTube for several hours and found the solution and it was a split screen turned on - in the &@(¥ing factory settings!!!! Thanks Apple! You wasted at least five hours of my time! And there are plenty of people with the same problem. Steve Jobs has to be rolling over in his grave. The speaker pops. The spell check is crap. The ability to move the cursor within a word is crap. The curser floats out of the word and ends up elsewhere. Good luck erasing and retyping. If you misspell a word it often selects the wrong word and the word is WAY off the context of the sentence and how it selects that word is beyond any logical exercise. Are Apple designers and technicians high? Very disappointed. Value for money: Ha ha ha ha ha Sound quality: pops, sometimes high and sometimes low. My $300 Android phone had much better quality of sound, but in fairness this might have something to do with the case I bought. Screen protection: This is refurbished. But at over $800 one would think they would throw in a $0.30 piece of plastic. Phone quality: Not impressed. It appears this phone is BETTER than Android at handling pictures and video.

I found the camera to be junk. Whenever I would scan my lotto ticket with my camera pointing at the ticket's barcode, it had all kinds of trouble scanning it. The performance of the camera is ridiculous. It even takes blurry pictures. But I ended up keeping and using the iPhone for 6 months, to try to give it time to grow on me. But facts are facts, and I could not deny any longer that the camera is terrible and the phone was way overpriced. Boy, was I a fool. I ended up selling it and getting a Samsung 23FE which scans barcodes in lightening speed with no issues. The camera functions better as well, and it is much cheaper. But one other thing about the iPhone that drove me nuts was the flipping up of an open page to close it. One flip up made it disappear out of sight, but does not make the application close.

I purchased the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max (Renewed) because I didn’t see the need to pay full price for a brand-new device. The phone arrived in an aftermarket box with a third-party charger, which I expected and had no issue with. The phone itself had small scratches and noticeable wear on the casing, which was disappointing but understandable for a renewed product at a discounted price. The battery life is decent. I ran a battery health check upon receiving it and found it had around 250 charging cycles, which was more than I expected given the release date. That said, after four months of use, the battery has held up well and hasn’t been a concern. Performance-wise, the phone is fast, responsive, and everything I expected from the 15 Pro Max. I love the USB-C charging and having access to the new Apple AI features, which makes the experience even better. Overall, this is a great option if you’re okay with some wear and tear.

iphone 15 pro max,4,2024-03-08,"Solid ""Renewed"" Value!. This item was purchased as an alternative to our Samsung Galaxy S23Ultra (still used for high quality camera) to reduce need for Android/Windows bridges to transfer files and to take advantage of the video camera capabilities for production purposes. Although it is ""renewed"", the iPhone has no noticeable physical imperfections, dings or scratches. As mentioned in another review, we also observed upon wireless carrier setup, this phone typically has 2 out of 4 bars signal strength in contrast to Samsung 4 out of 5 signal bars placed in the identical indoor locations with antennae facing identical local tower direction(s). It behaves like most modern MacOS systems (w/a few more extra steps to accomplish some tasks). We prefer fingerprint vs facial unlock similar to iPad/MacBooks and available external storage (micro-SD card), so those features are dearly missed. “Move to iOS"" (GooglePlayStore app) made 99% of the Android data/file(s) transfer relatively seamless, however, a few transferred contacts didn't have all ""Note"" details retained and had to be manually updated. ""Samsung Notes"" also had to be manually copy/pasted into Apple Notes along with Timers/Alarms having to be manually recreated. The final hurdle was the search for an app/program to convert/transfer our preferred ringtones files (i.e. "".mp3"", "".wav"", etc.) to Mac-specific "".m4r"" audio files which we found in Audacity (Apple forces one to add/access/remove audio files ONLY via iTunes). We experienced no issues connecting our Apple Watch, AirPods & even our Samsung Galaxy Buds+ via Bluetooth to this phone. Battery usage under the same daily routines of the Samsung S23Ultra appears to be about the same on average (2-4 days until observing15%-20% battery remaining). Because mobile phones cost as much as laptops these days, we always choose to apply tempered glass screen/lens protectors along w/obtaining full coverage cases for those times when ""life interrupts"". Two weeks into ownership, the navigational iQuirks are less cumbersome and the bouncing back & forth b/t Apple/Android is becoming more intuitive. Overall we expect this renewed item via Amazon to serve us as well as our previous ""Renewed"" Samsung S20Ultra & aforementioned S23Ultra. Solid ""Renewed"" value in this iPhone 15 Pro Max, 1TB!",-1,Battery Life & Charging

Overheating Issues: The phone gets hot very quickly during basic use, even when just browsing or texting. It’s uncomfortable to hold and concerning for long-term use. 2. Battery Life is Terrible: Despite the description claiming the battery was at 98%, the phone drains ridiculously fast. I can barely make it through a few hours before needing to charge again. For a phone advertised as “excellent,” this is unacceptable. 3. Scuffed Camera: The camera has visible scuffs on it, making it seem like no effort was made to refurbish or inspect the phone properly before selling it. 4. Battery Cycles Misleading: The phone already had 128 cycles, which isn’t what I would expect from a battery advertised as nearly new. This level of wear should have been disclosed upfront. 5. Stuck Without Options: I can’t go without a phone, so now I’m stuck with a subpar device in a predicament I didn’t sign up for. This was supposed to be a reliable, refurbished phone, but it feels like I’ve been sold something far from “excellent.” I’m very disappointed with this purchase and would strongly recommend others avoid this seller.

iphone se 3rd gen,2,2025-01-06,"Phantom touch issues in Renewed-Excellent phone. I was really excited to receive this. It was an upgrade from an iphone 8 that finally got too laggy to tolerate. Unfortunately this phone had phantom touch issues straight out of the package. Right away out of the package, I noticed that the screen felt oddly tacky/sticky. My finger didn't glide over it as smooth as I expected for a touchscreen. Then, during the setup process, I almost couldn't even sign into my apple account, because the screen kept freaking out while I was trying to type. It will randomly think I am pressing somewhere on the bottom left 2 inches of the screen. Depending on the app I'm trying to scroll through, it will randomly click on youtube videos or ads, upvote comments, close the keyboard while I'm trying to type, etc. It's not constant, but does happen frequently, so far about a dozen separate times in the last 12 hours, and it lasts for several minutes when the issue starts. I have wiped off the screen with a screen cleaner spray and a microfiber cloth 4 separate times today to no avail. Several times when the issue happened, the screen looked spotless. I've gone into settings and disabled anything that looked like it could even maybe cause this, including assistive touch. Something I didn't notice until after the issue started: the screen of the phone has no cosmetic damage, however the aluminum on the right side, about an inch above the bottom of the phone, has some very obvious scuffs/gouges, including about a centimeter where the paint is scraped off, right where the screen meets the aluminum. Clearly this is where they pried the old screen off for replacement. Unfortunately this screen is a poor replacement. My iphone 8 was purchased refurbished too, but has not had phantom touch issues in the 6 years I owned it. I'm now going to have to transfer my apple account and cell service back to my old laggy phone, return this one, wait for my return to be received, then wait for a replacement to be shipped and hope it doesn't have the same issue. I was really looking forward to finally having a decent phone again.",-1,Battery Life & Charging

iphone se 3rd gen,1,2023-06-16,"Frustrating Experience with SE iPhone Purchase - Beware of Hidden Fees!. I recently purchased an SE iPhone from this third-party seller on Amazon, hoping for a seamless experience. However, my journey with this phone turned out to be quite disappointing. Initially, the phone seemed fine, but as I started using it, I noticed a few concerning issues. The device intermittently failed to register touches, and it struggled to establish connections with other Apple devices like my AirPods and iPad. Due to these problems, I decided to return the phone. I must acknowledge that the refund process was prompt. However, I was surprised to find that the refunded amount was $20 less than what I originally paid. This discrepancy prompted me to reach out for clarification. To my dismay, they first justified the deduction as a ""shipping fee"" for valuable items. When I questioned this explanation, they quickly changed their stance, claiming it was a ""restocking fee."" Finally, when I pointed out that the item was labeled as ""free return"" and ""free delivery,"" they resorted to accusing me of not returning the charger and imposed an additional $20 fee. I want to make it explicitly clear that I returned the item within the specified time window, and I included all the original accessories. This unwarranted deduction, accompanied by the seller's inconsistent explanations, left me feeling frustrated and deceived. Writing this review serves as a warning to other potential buyers. Not only did I waste my time setting up and returning a faulty product, but I was also unfairly charged a ""shipping/restocking/charger fee"" despite complying with all return requirements. Please exercise caution when dealing with this seller, as my experience indicates a lack of transparency and integrity. In summary, I regret my decision to purchase this SE iPhone from this third-party seller on Amazon. I hope my review helps others avoid the inconvenience, frustration, and unnecessary fees I encountered throughout this process.",-1,Phone Functionality & Defects

I am not a fan of Apple products at all (seen so many friends with broken iPhone screens and broken MacBook chargers), but was still surprised at how terrible the durability of this iPhone is. I bought this phone for my mom, along with a protective case. The first time she dropped it from a low height, parts of the edges of the phone broke off but it still worked. I then bought a military grade case for her after this incident. She dropped the phone a second time and the battery no longer is recognized by the phone. I have owned cheapo Motorola phones in the past that I dropped many many times, and nothing like this has ever happened; they were much more durable even with a non-militiary grade case. This experience with my mom's iPhone just further reinforced my extreme bias against Apple products hardware-wise.

iphone se 3rd gen,4,2024-06-19,"Good enough. First time iPhone user.. This is my first iPhone after 16 years of Androids (in $50 to $800 range). Got this as a secondary device. The phone is OK. I am not a fanboy of any kind, and it is OK for the secondary use case I need it for, but would not switch to it as my daily driver. I would recommend it to some of my friends who do not like change. They would probably like this more over a lot of Android innovations which are often cool and innovative but when they are not, they are annoying too. But once you have the power to customize your experience, it is hard to accept substandard solutions. The notification center is pure garbage. It is literally worst than it had ever been in android. Other UI/UX solutions are highly questionable too. I had to switch between 3 different places to change something about the sleep app. Lol, it was so stupid it was fun. Cannot quite believe this is a company known for user experience. I do appreciate the ability to remove many stock apps. Not being in apple ecosystem it is great to remove facetime and similar things I will never use. Google overreaching lock-in is annoying. Though I use custom ROMs to remove Google garbage, but that is not a solution for everyone. I really like that Apple lets me remove their trademark apps. I do not want to not use them. I just want them out. Big bonus points for that. Also love the ability to disable iMessage. I do not want my few iPhone-owning friends to know I have this device because they will send me social crap (aka videos) and now I have the excuse that when it comes as MMS it is un-viewable and I do not have to engage. They can always send it to me by email but they are to lazy tod o that, hehe. So disabling iMessage is a saver! VERY happy with it. Some people just do not understand you do not care about the latest new trends. Also love the physical button and the small size. Hate not having an aux jack and the non-universal power connector. Overall, I am OK with it for the excellent like-new renewed price of 50% off. If they keep making small, mid-range phones with physical buttons I might stay a customer for a long time. At full price, big screen, no button, it would be a no from me. Cannot see the appeal overall. It is a decent 4 stars for a person not locked to any ecosystem.",0,Battery Life & Charging
iphone se 3rd gen,4,2024-12-14,"Definitely a used phone, but in decent shape for the price. There's no doubt this was a heavily used phone. I feel that ""renewed"" is a bit of a marketing ploy, because it's USED, plain and simple. I can see the marks where the previous user must have attached a lens over the camera, and there are faint ""in the pocket"" scratches on the screen. Thankfully these marks and scratches are not visible except in direct sunlight, so they do not interfere with the picture quality. The battery also seems to be in decent shape for a used phone. My theory is these phones are turned in for credit when people upgrade to the next latest-and-greatest phone. I wasn't impressed with how the phone was delivered to me with a totally drained battery. That and the OS was not properly reset. This was definitely not the same experience as buying a new phone from Apple. But again, I'm judging this phone with price in mind. As for the phone itself, I wanted a phone, not a tablet / phablet, and this phone is great in that regard. It fits wonderfully in my pocket, and yet it has all the capabilities of a larger phone. The phone is fast, responsive, runs the latest iOS, has a great camera, and supports the latest 5G cellular protocol. It feels good in the hand, and the signal quality is what I expect in my area. The funny thing is that I didn't want to upgrade to this phone (I was happy with my old Windows phone), but when my old phone stopped working, I had to get a replacement, and I'm kinda glad now because this phone is very good for what I'm interested in - phone, text, photography, mapping, hiking, etc. For everything else, I rather use my iPad.",-1,Battery Life & Charging

Here's my review, with an emphasis on its performance as a travel companion: 1. Compact Design: The iPhone SE's compact size makes it an ideal travel companion. Its smaller form factor allows for easy handling and effortless portability, fitting comfortably in pockets or small bags. Despite its size, it doesn't compromise on functionality or performance. 2. Compatibility with Google Fi: Utilizing the Google Fi service on the iPhone SE enhances its value as a travel phone. Google Fi provides seamless connectivity and coverage across multiple networks, including international roaming options in many countries. This allows travelers to stay connected and avoid excessive roaming charges while exploring different destinations. 3. Performance and Software: The iPhone SE 3rd Gen delivers impressive performance with its A13 Bionic chip. It offers a smooth and responsive user experience, enabling swift app launches, multitasking, and smooth browsing. The latest iOS updates ensure that users have access to the latest features and security enhancements, making it a reliable device for travel. 4. Camera Quality: The iPhone SE's camera capabilities are noteworthy, especially for travel photography enthusiasts. With a 12 MP rear camera, it captures vibrant and detailed photos, even in challenging lighting conditions. The Portrait mode and Smart HDR features add depth and enhance the overall quality of images. Additionally, the phone's 4K video recording capability allows for capturing memorable moments in high resolution. 5. Battery Life and Charging: The battery life of the iPhone SE is decent, allowing for a full day of moderate usage during travel. However, heavy usage or extended periods of navigation and media consumption may require frequent charging. The device supports fast charging, which is beneficial for quickly replenishing the battery when needed. 6. Storage Capacity: The 64GB storage capacity may be limiting for some travelers who tend to capture a large number of photos and videos or download extensive offline content. Consideration should be given to managing storage and utilizing cloud-based solutions or external storage options for extended trips. Overall, the Apple iPhone SE 3rd Gen, paired with Google Fi service, offers a reliable and compact travel phone experience. Its small size, powerful performance, compatibility with Google Fi, and impressive camera capabilities make it a great choice for travelers. While battery life and storage capacity could be potential considerations, the overall package of features and functionality make it a solid option for those seeking a travel-friendly device.",0,Battery Life & Charging

All seems well, it just that it said it should have more than 80% battery life remaining... the one I got has 79%... so was borderline to return it... however I waited 3 weeks to getvit delivered to begin with and also needed to test a few things I needed the phone for... a better carrier, esim, adapters to use it for recording audio, camera apps, playback on a tv using cable vs wifi, etc. Found on Amazon a battery phone case that could supplement the existing battery so all the tests went well and ended up keeping it. Also looked online and there is a service to replace the battery with a new one for around $80... hope I won't need it soon.",-1,Phone Functionality & Defects
iphone se 3rd gen,4,2023-09-12,"Trusted Seller and Excellent Customer Service, but Came With Broken Charging Block. Overall, I had a good experience and I would give 4.5 stars. The only downside was that the charging block that the phone came with did not work. I emailed TetchyTech asking them to send me a new one and they replied within minutes stating they had sent me a new one! Excellent customer service. Just like the product description said, it came with a SIM card tool, a charging cable and a power block to plug the charger into an electrical outlet. The charging cable appeared to be a third-party cable, ANKER brand, but it fit into the phone’s charging port. Also, the cable seemed brand new! I’m excited about that because it should last a long time. The block was first-party, but had lots of marks and scratches, making it look dirty. The charging cable worked just fine, but the block that came with the phone did not work at all. I tested both the block and cable with multiple other parts and outlets and confirmed that it was the block that was broken. But like I said earlier, I emailed TetchyTech and they immediately responded and shipped me a new block. I was happy about that. If I didn’t already have a backup charger, I would be pretty upset with TetchyTech for giving me a broken charging block. So just be aware of that. The iPhone itself: Like new. Very small signs of use, all barely noticeable, including a tiny scratch on the back. Excellent job on the outside of the phone. Everything worked perfectly except that on 2 different occasions, both in the first week, the phone wouldn’t respond when I tried to unlock it and the screen stayed black for about 15 seconds. Then, it started working again. It hasn’t happened in the last week and a half or so, so I’m not too worried about it. The phone came 95% charged.",-1,Phone Functionality & Defects
iphone se 3rd gen,4,2025-02-22,Very affordable but do consider keeping a charger cord & or extra battery booster when out and about. Awesome affordable I phone. My biggest problem is it seems that refurbished phones ship out with batteries at 85% capacity as a normal standard.

iphone se 3rd gen,4,2024-11-04,great deal but teeny tiny phone. My purpose in getting this phone was both to have an iphone for around $200 and also have something that didn't need a separate fanny pack just to fit on my person. This one fit the bill perfectly but is maybe even smaller than I intended. You won't be winning any speed typing competitions on this munchkin sized bit of the iphone upper crust but at least you won't be carrying a basketball backboard around in your pocket either. I'm happy with my purchase - perfect condition with apple packing material still on the phone in a condition that could only have come from the factory itself. Must have been open box.

iphone se 3rd gen,4,2024-09-13,Value buy if you only have a phone because you have to. I only get a new phone when apps force me to. I considered changing banks because they stopped supporting whatever IOS my 6S had. 200 bucks for a phone still in production is not bad at all. I miss the screen size of the 6S and probably should have spent $100 more for the 13 just for legibility and keyboard space :( I can really feel the increased processing power coming from the ancient phone to the SE but that is not really important to me. The battery is unimpressive! It last about 2 days for a guy in the bottom 10% of screen time. The camera is good enough for gov't work.

External aspect - Great, front seems brand new, on the back few minor scratches. Im a very detailed person, I think majority of people would not even notice those tiny scratches on the back. Internal - As I mentioned earlier, battery not great. Rest of it seems pretty good with just one day of use. At first, while setting it up it got a little warm, but was expected.

The phone absolutely wins for the hardware and os stability, performance needed, and overall smoothness to work all day on it. It’s much better even than newer devices from android at budget tier 5g. However, the network was absolutely horrific until I changed the network setting on it to 5G on. I was very unsatisfied with it up till that change. Apparently it has a major issue optimizing things around 5g signal so you need to just go all 5g or none. I had way too many connection drops and unacceptable latency with it until I found this out. Otherwise it’s 5 star for professional, im an independent contractor and the apps used to complete my work absolutely perfect in terms of the hardware and system like camera not lagging and the overall login and speed of use daily all day reliable.

Looked on the Verizon site and it showed me it was a 64GB phone, not 128GB. Returned without issue. 2) Second phone I received looked good too, started the migration but it wouldn't activate. Turned out not to be a US version, it was tagged as ""Rest of World."" The eSIM functionality didn't work. I had Verizon send me a physical SIM card and we were able to get it activated. Unfortunately there was other functionality disabled as well, not NFC for ApplePay so you could add cards but not use it at a terminal. Also, GPS resolution was hobbled, completely useless for car navigation. Returned without issue, but much frustration before the return. 3) Picked one that was sold and shipped by Amazon, not sure if that made the difference but there was no problem with the phone.

That is not the case with the phone I received. It has a sort-of ""mini"" overlay which is noticeably not the same since the resulting phone is thicker and depending upon how one holds the phone when using it as a phone, less comfortable than one might expect or have grown used to experiencing. One may have the disconcerting experience of having the edge of an earring encountering the edge of the stiff plastic overlay, The overlay is removable and there were no large scratches, Otherwise, the phone seems to work even if it now uses IOS 18 rather than the original version. I would have preferred the original version. IOS 18 has more of the latest IOS nonsense: ""haptics"" that are useless AND annoying, still more intrusion into one's personal life, and I couldn't transfer my music library -- the transfer from ios 17 kept failing in a bizarre manner. As usual, Apple now wants to know everything. It's my phone, not theirs. Actually, an iPhone 6 -- really -- is a better user experience mostly because the applications are smaller and more focused. In summary, the ""renewed"" phone is a disappointment since it doesn't have quite the same look-and-feel as an original.
